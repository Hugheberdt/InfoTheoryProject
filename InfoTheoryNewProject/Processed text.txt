remarks on the origin of species introduction when on board h m s beagle as naturalist i was much struck withcertain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america and in the geological relations of the present to the past inhabitantsof that continent these facts seemed to me to throw some light on theorigin of species that mystery of mysteries as it has been called byone of our greatest philosophers on my return home it occurred to me in that something might perhaps be made out on this question bypatiently accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which couldpossibly have any bearing on it after five years work i allowed myselfto speculate on the subject and drew up some short notes these ienlarged in into a sketch of the conclusions which then seemed tome probable from that period to the present day i have steadily pursuedthe same object i hope that i may be excused for entering on thesepersonal details as i give them to show that i have not been hasty incoming to a decision my work is now nearly finished but as it will take me two or three moreyears to complete it and as my health is far from strong i have beenurged to publish this abstract i have more especially been induced todo this as mr wallace who is now studying the natural history ofthe malay archipelago has arrived at almost exactly the same generalconclusions that i have on the origin of species last year he sent tome a memoir on this subject with a request that i would forward itto sir charles lyell who sent it to the linnean society and it ispublished in the third volume of the journal of that society sir c lyell and dr hooker who both knew of my work the latter having readmy sketch of honoured me by thinking it advisable to publish withmr wallace s excellent memoir some brief extracts from my manuscripts this abstract which i now publish must necessarily be imperfect icannot here give references and authorities for my several statements and i must trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy no doubt errors will have crept in though i hope i have always beencautious in trusting to good authorities alone i can here give onlythe general conclusions at which i have arrived with a few facts inillustration but which i hope in most cases will suffice no one canfeel more sensible than i do of the necessity of hereafter publishing indetail all the facts with references on which my conclusions have beengrounded and i hope in a future work to do this for i am well awarethat scarcely a single point is discussed in this volume on which factscannot be adduced often apparently leading to conclusions directlyopposite to those at which i have arrived a fair result can be obtainedonly by fully stating and balancing the facts and arguments on bothsides of each question and this cannot possibly be here done i much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction ofacknowledging the generous assistance which i have received from verymany naturalists some of them personally unknown to me i cannot however let this opportunity pass without expressing my deepobligations to dr hooker who for the last fifteen years has aided mein every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellentjudgment in considering the origin of species it is quite conceivable that anaturalist reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings on their embryological relations their geographical distribution geological succession and other such facts might come to theconclusion that each species had not been independently created buthad descended like varieties from other species nevertheless sucha conclusion even if well founded would be unsatisfactory until itcould be shown how the innumerable species inhabiting this worldhave been modified so as to acquire that perfection of structure andcoadaptation which most justly excites our admiration naturalistscontinually refer to external conditions such as climate food etc as the only possible cause of variation in one very limited sense as we shall hereafter see this may be true but it is preposterous toattribute to mere external conditions the structure for instance of the woodpecker with its feet tail beak and tongue so admirablyadapted to catch insects under the bark of trees in the case of themisseltoe which draws its nourishment from certain trees which hasseeds that must be transported by certain birds and which has flowerswith separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain insectsto bring pollen from one flower to the other it is equally preposterousto account for the structure of this parasite with its relations toseveral distinct organic beings by the effects of external conditions or of habit or of the volition of the plant itself the author of the vestiges of creation would i presume say that after a certain unknown number of generations some bird had given birthto a woodpecker and some plant to the misseltoe and that these hadbeen produced perfect as we now see them but this assumption seems tome to be no explanation for it leaves the case of the coadaptations oforganic beings to each other and to their physical conditions of life untouched and unexplained it is therefore of the highest importance to gain a clear insight intothe means of modification and coadaptation at the commencement ofmy observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study ofdomesticated animals and of cultivated plants would offer the bestchance of making out this obscure problem nor have i been disappointed in this and in all other perplexing cases i have invariably found thatour knowledge imperfect though it be of variation under domestication afforded the best and safest clue i may venture to express myconviction of the high value of such studies although they have beenvery commonly neglected by naturalists from these considerations i shall devote the first chapter of thisabstract to variation under domestication we shall thus see that alarge amount of hereditary modification is at least possible and whatis equally or more important we shall see how great is the power of manin accumulating by his selection successive slight variations i willthen pass on to the variability of species in a state of nature buti shall unfortunately be compelled to treat this subject far toobriefly as it can be treated properly only by giving long catalogues offacts we shall however be enabled to discuss what circumstancesare most favourable to variation in the next chapter the strugglefor existence amongst all organic beings throughout the world whichinevitably follows from their high geometrical powers of increase willbe treated of this is the doctrine of malthus applied to the wholeanimal and vegetable kingdoms as many more individuals of each speciesare born than can possibly survive and as consequently there is afrequently recurring struggle for existence it follows that any being if it vary however slightly in any manner profitable to itself underthe complex and sometimes varying conditions of life will have a betterchance of surviving and thus be naturally selected from the strongprinciple of inheritance any selected variety will tend to propagateits new and modified form this fundamental subject of natural selection will be treated atsome length in the fourth chapter and we shall then see how naturalselection almost inevitably causes much extinction of the less improvedforms of life and induces what i have called divergence of character in the next chapter i shall discuss the complex and little known laws ofvariation and of correlation of growth in the four succeeding chapters the most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given namely first the difficulties of transitions or in understanding howa simple being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into ahighly developed being or elaborately constructed organ secondlythe subject of instinct or the mental powers of animals thirdly hybridism or the infertility of species and the fertility of varietieswhen intercrossed and fourthly the imperfection of the geologicalrecord in the next chapter i shall consider the geological successionof organic beings throughout time in the eleventh and twelfth theirgeographical distribution throughout space in the thirteenth theirclassification or mutual affinities both when mature and in anembryonic condition in the last chapter i shall give a briefrecapitulation of the whole work and a few concluding remarks no one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained inregard to the origin of species and varieties if he makes due allowancefor our profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of allthe beings which live around us who can explain why one species rangeswidely and is very numerous and why another allied species has a narrowrange and is rare yet these relations are of the highest importance for they determine the present welfare and as i believe the futuresuccess and modification of every inhabitant of this world still lessdo we know of the mutual relations of the innumerable inhabitants of theworld during the many past geological epochs in its history althoughmuch remains obscure and will long remain obscure i can entertain nodoubt after the most deliberate study and dispassionate judgment ofwhich i am capable that the view which most naturalists entertain and which i formerly entertained namely that each species has beenindependently created is erroneous i am fully convinced that speciesare not immutable but that those belonging to what are called thesame genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinctspecies in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties of any onespecies are the descendants of that species furthermore i am convincedthat natural selection has been the main but not exclusive means ofmodification variation under domestication causes of variability effects of habit correlation of growth inheritance character of domestic varieties difficulty ofdistinguishing between varieties and species origin of domesticvarieties from one or more species domestic pigeons their differencesand origin principle of selection anciently followed its effects methodical and unconscious selection unknown origin of our domesticproductions circumstances favourable to man s power of selection when we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub variety ofour older cultivated plants and animals one of the first points whichstrikes us is that they generally differ much more from each other than do the individuals of any one species or variety in a state ofnature when we reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animalswhich have been cultivated and which have varied during all ages underthe most different climates and treatment i think we are driven toconclude that this greater variability is simply due to our domesticproductions having been raised under conditions of life not so uniformas and somewhat different from those to which the parent species havebeen exposed under nature there is also i think some probabilityin the view propounded by andrew knight that this variability may bepartly connected with excess of food it seems pretty clear that organicbeings must be exposed during several generations to the new conditionsof life to cause any appreciable amount of variation and that when theorganisation has once begun to vary it generally continues to vary formany generations no case is on record of a variable being ceasing to bevariable under cultivation our oldest cultivated plants such as wheat still often yield new varieties our oldest domesticated animals arestill capable of rapid improvement or modification it has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability whatever they may be generally act whether during the early or lateperiod of development of the embryo or at the instant of conception geoffroy st hilaire s experiments show that unnatural treatment of theembryo causes monstrosities and monstrosities cannot be separated byany clear line of distinction from mere variations but i am stronglyinclined to suspect that the most frequent cause of variability maybe attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having beenaffected prior to the act of conception several reasons make me believein this but the chief one is the remarkable effect which confinement orcultivation has on the functions of the reproductive system thissystem appearing to be far more susceptible than any other part of theorganisation to the action of any change in the conditions of life nothing is more easy than to tame an animal and few things moredifficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement even in themany cases when the male and female unite how many animals thereare which will not breed though living long under not very closeconfinement in their native country this is generally attributed tovitiated instincts but how many cultivated plants display the utmostvigour and yet rarely or never seed in some few such cases it hasbeen found out that very trifling changes such as a little more or lesswater at some particular period of growth will determine whether or notthe plant sets a seed i cannot here enter on the copious details whichi have collected on this curious subject but to show how singular thelaws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement i may just mention that carnivorous animals even from the tropics breed in this country pretty freely under confinement with theexception of the plantigrades or bear family whereas carnivorousbirds with the rarest exceptions hardly ever lay fertile eggs manyexotic plants have pollen utterly worthless in the same exactcondition as in the most sterile hybrids when on the one hand wesee domesticated animals and plants though often weak and sickly yetbreeding quite freely under confinement and when on the other hand we see individuals though taken young from a state of nature perfectly tamed long lived and healthy of which i could give numerousinstances yet having their reproductive system so seriously affectedby unperceived causes as to fail in acting we need not be surprisedat this system when it does act under confinement acting not quiteregularly and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents orvariable sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture but on thisview we owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility andvariability is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden i may add that as some organisms will breed most freely under themost unnatural conditions for instance the rabbit and ferret keptin hutches showing that their reproductive system has not been thusaffected so will some animals and plants withstand domestication orcultivation and vary very slightly perhaps hardly more than in a stateof nature a long list could easily be given of sporting plants by this termgardeners mean a single bud or offset which suddenly assumes a new andsometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant such buds can be propagated by grafting etc and sometimes by seed these sports are extremely rare under nature but far from rare undercultivation and in this case we see that the treatment of the parenthas affected a bud or offset and not the ovules or pollen but it isthe opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential differencebetween a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation sothat in fact sports support my view that variability may be largelyattributed to the ovules or pollen or to both having been affected bythe treatment of the parent prior to the act of conception these casesanyhow show that variation is not necessarily connected as some authorshave supposed with the act of generation seedlings from the same fruit and the young of the same litter sometimes differ considerably from each other though both the youngand the parents as muller has remarked have apparently been exposed toexactly the same conditions of life and this shows how unimportant thedirect effects of the conditions of life are in comparison with the lawsof reproduction and of growth and of inheritance for had the actionof the conditions been direct if any of the young had varied all wouldprobably have varied in the same manner to judge how much in the caseof any variation we should attribute to the direct action of heat moisture light food etc is most difficult my impression is thatwith animals such agencies have produced very little direct effect though apparently more in the case of plants under this point of view mr buckman s recent experiments on plants seem extremely valuable when all or nearly all the individuals exposed to certain conditions areaffected in the same way the change at first appears to be directlydue to such conditions but in some cases it can be shown that quiteopposite conditions produce similar changes of structure neverthelesssome slight amount of change may i think be attributed to the directaction of the conditions of life as in some cases increased size fromamount of food colour from particular kinds of food and from light andperhaps the thickness of fur from climate habit also has a decided influence as in the period of flowering withplants when transported from one climate to another in animals it hasa more marked effect for instance i find in the domestic duck thatthe bones of the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more in proportion to the whole skeleton than do the same bones in thewild duck and i presume that this change may be safely attributed tothe domestic duck flying much less and walking more than its wildparent the great and inherited development of the udders in cows andgoats in countries where they are habitually milked in comparison withthe state of these organs in other countries is another instance of theeffect of use not a single domestic animal can be named which has notin some country drooping ears and the view suggested by some authors that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the ear fromthe animals not being much alarmed by danger seems probable there are many laws regulating variation some few of which can be dimlyseen and will be hereafter briefly mentioned i will here only alludeto what may be called correlation of growth any change in the embryoor larva will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal inmonstrosities the correlations between quite distinct parts are verycurious and many instances are given in isidore geoffroy st hilaire sgreat work on this subject breeders believe that long limbs are almostalways accompanied by an elongated head some instances of correlationare quite whimsical thus cats with blue eyes are invariably deaf colour and constitutional peculiarities go together of which manyremarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants from thefacts collected by heusinger it appears that white sheep and pigs aredifferently affected from coloured individuals by certain vegetablepoisons hairless dogs have imperfect teeth long haired andcoarse haired animals are apt to have as is asserted long or manyhorns pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes pigeons with short beaks have small feet and those with long beakslarge feet hence if man goes on selecting and thus augmenting anypeculiarity he will almost certainly unconsciously modify other partsof the structure owing to the mysterious laws of the correlation ofgrowth the result of the various quite unknown or dimly seen laws ofvariation is infinitely complex and diversified it is well worth whilecarefully to study the several treatises published on some of our oldcultivated plants as on the hyacinth potato even the dahlia etc and it is really surprising to note the endless points in structure andconstitution in which the varieties and sub varieties differ slightlyfrom each other the whole organisation seems to have become plastic and tends to depart in some small degree from that of the parental type any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us but thenumber and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure boththose of slight and those of considerable physiological importance is endless dr prosper lucas s treatise in two large volumes is thefullest and the best on this subject no breeder doubts how strongis the tendency to inheritance like produces like is his fundamentalbelief doubts have been thrown on this principle by theoretical writersalone when a deviation appears not unfrequently and we see it in thefather and child we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the sameoriginal cause acting on both but when amongst individuals apparentlyexposed to the same conditions any very rare deviation due to someextraordinary combination of circumstances appears in the parent say once amongst several million individuals and it reappears in thechild the mere doctrine of chances almost compels us to attributeits reappearance to inheritance every one must have heard of cases ofalbinism prickly skin hairy bodies etc appearing in several membersof the same family if strange and rare deviations of structure aretruly inherited less strange and commoner deviations may be freelyadmitted to be inheritable perhaps the correct way of viewing thewhole subject would be to look at the inheritance of every characterwhatever as the rule and non inheritance as the anomaly the laws governing inheritance are quite unknown no one can say why thesame peculiarity in different individuals of the same species and inindividuals of different species is sometimes inherited and sometimesnot so why the child often reverts in certain characters to itsgrandfather or grandmother or other much more remote ancestor why apeculiarity is often transmitted from one sex to both sexes or to onesex alone more commonly but not exclusively to the like sex it is afact of some little importance to us that peculiarities appearingin the males of our domestic breeds are often transmitted eitherexclusively or in a much greater degree to males alone a much moreimportant rule which i think may be trusted is that at whateverperiod of life a peculiarity first appears it tends to appear in theoffspring at a corresponding age though sometimes earlier in manycases this could not be otherwise thus the inherited peculiaritiesin the horns of cattle could appear only in the offspring when nearlymature peculiarities in the silkworm are known to appear at thecorresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage but hereditary diseases andsome other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider extension and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity shouldappear at any particular age yet that it does tend to appear in theoffspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent ibelieve this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining thelaws of embryology these remarks are of course confined to the firstappearance of the peculiarity and not to its primary cause which mayhave acted on the ovules or male element in nearly the same manner asin the crossed offspring from a short horned cow by a long horned bull the greater length of horn though appearing late in life is clearlydue to the male element having alluded to the subject of reversion i may here refer toa statement often made by naturalists namely that our domesticvarieties when run wild gradually but certainly revert in character totheir aboriginal stocks hence it has been argued that no deductions canbe drawn from domestic races to species in a state of nature i have invain endeavoured to discover on what decisive facts the above statementhas so often and so boldly been made there would be great difficultyin proving its truth we may safely conclude that very many of the moststrongly marked domestic varieties could not possibly live in a wildstate in many cases we do not know what the aboriginal stock was andso could not tell whether or not nearly perfect reversion had ensued it would be quite necessary in order to prevent the effects ofintercrossing that only a single variety should be turned loose inits new home nevertheless as our varieties certainly do occasionallyrevert in some of their characters to ancestral forms it seems to menot improbable that if we could succeed in naturalising or were tocultivate during many generations the several races for instance of the cabbage in very poor soil in which case however some effectwould have to be attributed to the direct action of the poor soil that they would to a large extent or even wholly revert to the wildaboriginal stock whether or not the experiment would succeed is not ofgreat importance for our line of argument for by the experiment itselfthe conditions of life are changed if it could be shown that ourdomestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to reversion thatis to lose their acquired characters whilst kept under unchangedconditions and whilst kept in a considerable body so that freeintercrossing might check by blending together any slight deviationsof structure in such case i grant that we could deduce nothing fromdomestic varieties in regard to species but there is not a shadow ofevidence in favour of this view to assert that we could not breedour cart and race horses long and short horned cattle and poultry ofvarious breeds and esculent vegetables for an almost infinite numberof generations would be opposed to all experience i may add that whenunder nature the conditions of life do change variations and reversionsof character probably do occur but natural selection as will hereafterbe explained will determine how far the new characters thus arisingshall be preserved when we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domesticanimals and plants and compare them with species closely alliedtogether we generally perceive in each domestic race as alreadyremarked less uniformity of character than in true species domesticraces of the same species also often have a somewhat monstrouscharacter by which i mean that although differing from each other and from the other species of the same genus in several triflingrespects they often differ in an extreme degree in some one part bothwhen compared one with another and more especially when compared withall the species in nature to which they are nearest allied with theseexceptions and with that of the perfect fertility of varieties whencrossed a subject hereafter to be discussed domestic races of thesame species differ from each other in the same manner as only in mostcases in a lesser degree than do closely allied species of the samegenus in a state of nature i think this must be admitted when we findthat there are hardly any domestic races either amongst animals orplants which have not been ranked by some competent judges asmere varieties and by other competent judges as the descendants ofaboriginally distinct species if any marked distinction existedbetween domestic races and species this source of doubt could not soperpetually recur it has often been stated that domestic races do notdiffer from each other in characters of generic value i think it couldbe shown that this statement is hardly correct but naturalists differmost widely in determining what characters are of generic value allsuch valuations being at present empirical moreover on the view ofthe origin of genera which i shall presently give we have no rightto expect often to meet with generic differences in our domesticatedproductions when we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference betweenthe domestic races of the same species we are soon involved in doubt from not knowing whether they have descended from one or severalparent species this point if it could be cleared up would beinteresting if for instance it could be shown that the greyhound bloodhound terrier spaniel and bull dog which we all know propagatetheir kind so truly were the offspring of any single species then suchfacts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutabilityof the many very closely allied and natural species for instance ofthe many foxes inhabiting different quarters of the world i do notbelieve as we shall presently see that all our dogs have descendedfrom any one wild species but in the case of some other domesticraces there is presumptive or even strong evidence in favour of thisview it has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animalsand plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary andlikewise to withstand diverse climates i do not dispute that thesecapacities have added largely to the value of most of our domesticatedproductions but how could a savage possibly know when he first tamedan animal whether it would vary in succeeding generations and whetherit would endure other climates has the little variability of the ass orguinea fowl or the small power of endurance of warmth by the rein deer or of cold by the common camel prevented their domestication icannot doubt that if other animals and plants equal in number to ourdomesticated productions and belonging to equally diverse classes andcountries were taken from a state of nature and could be made to breedfor an equal number of generations under domestication they wouldvary on an average as largely as the parent species of our existingdomesticated productions have varied in the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants ido not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion whetherthey have descended from one or several species the argument mainlyrelied on by those who believe in the multiple origin of our domesticanimals is that we find in the most ancient records more especially onthe monuments of egypt much diversity in the breeds and that some ofthe breeds closely resemble perhaps are identical with those stillexisting even if this latter fact were found more strictly andgenerally true than seems to me to be the case what does it show butthat some of our breeds originated there four or five thousand yearsago but mr horner s researches have rendered it in some degreeprobable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured potteryexisted in the valley of the nile thirteen or fourteen thousand yearsago and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods savages like those of tierra del fuego or australia who possess asemi domestic dog may not have existed in egypt the whole subject must i think remain vague nevertheless i may without here entering on any details state that from geographical andother considerations i think it highly probable that our domestic dogshave descended from several wild species in regard to sheep and goatsi can form no opinion i should think from facts communicated to me bymr blyth on the habits voice and constitution etc of the humpedindian cattle that these had descended from a different aboriginalstock from our european cattle and several competent judges believethat these latter have had more than one wild parent with respect tohorses from reasons which i cannot give here i am doubtfully inclinedto believe in opposition to several authors that all the races havedescended from one wild stock mr blyth whose opinion from his largeand varied stores of knowledge i should value more than that of almostany one thinks that all the breeds of poultry have proceeded fromthe common wild indian fowl gallus bankiva in regard to ducks andrabbits the breeds of which differ considerably from each other instructure i do not doubt that they all have descended from the commonwild duck and rabbit the doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from severalaboriginal stocks has been carried to an absurd extreme by someauthors they believe that every race which breeds true let thedistinctive characters be ever so slight has had its wild prototype at this rate there must have existed at least a score of species of wildcattle as many sheep and several goats in europe alone and severaleven within great britain one author believes that there formerlyexisted in great britain eleven wild species of sheep peculiar to it when we bear in mind that britain has now hardly one peculiar mammal and france but few distinct from those of germany and conversely andso with hungary spain etc but that each of these kingdoms possessesseveral peculiar breeds of cattle sheep etc we must admit that manydomestic breeds have originated in europe for whence could they havebeen derived as these several countries do not possess a number ofpeculiar species as distinct parent stocks so it is in india even inthe case of the domestic dogs of the whole world which i fully admithave probably descended from several wild species i cannot doubt thatthere has been an immense amount of inherited variation who can believethat animals closely resembling the italian greyhound the bloodhound the bull dog or blenheim spaniel etc so unlike all wildcanidae ever existed freely in a state of nature it has often beenloosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by thecrossing of a few aboriginal species but by crossing we can get onlyforms in some degree intermediate between their parents and if weaccount for our several domestic races by this process we mustadmit the former existence of the most extreme forms as the italiangreyhound bloodhound bull dog etc in the wild state moreover the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatlyexaggerated there can be no doubt that a race may be modifiedby occasional crosses if aided by the careful selection of thoseindividual mongrels which present any desired character but thata race could be obtained nearly intermediate between two extremelydifferent races or species i can hardly believe sir j sebrightexpressly experimentised for this object and failed the offspring fromthe first cross between two pure breeds is tolerably and sometimes as ihave found with pigeons extremely uniform and everything seems simpleenough but when these mongrels are crossed one with another for severalgenerations hardly two of them will be alike and then the extremedifficulty or rather utter hopelessness of the task becomes apparent certainly a breed intermediate between two very distinct breeds couldnot be got without extreme care and long continued selection nor cani find a single case on record of a permanent race having been thusformed on the breeds of the domestic pigeon believing that it is always best to study some special group i have after deliberation taken up domestic pigeons i have kept every breedwhich i could purchase or obtain and have been most kindly favouredwith skins from several quarters of the world more especially by thehonourable w elliot from india and by the honourable c murray frompersia many treatises in different languages have been published onpigeons and some of them are very important as being of considerableantiquity i have associated with several eminent fanciers and havebeen permitted to join two of the london pigeon clubs the diversity ofthe breeds is something astonishing compare the english carrier and theshort faced tumbler and see the wonderful difference in their beaks entailing corresponding differences in their skulls the carrier more especially the male bird is also remarkable from the wonderfuldevelopment of the carunculated skin about the head and this isaccompanied by greatly elongated eyelids very large external orificesto the nostrils and a wide gape of mouth the short faced tumbler has abeak in outline almost like that of a finch and the common tumbler hasthe singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height ina compact flock and tumbling in the air head over heels the runt is abird of great size with long massive beak and large feet some of thesub breeds of runts have very long necks others very long wings andtails others singularly short tails the barb is allied to the carrier but instead of a very long beak has a very short and very broadone the pouter has a much elongated body wings and legs and itsenormously developed crop which it glories in inflating may wellexcite astonishment and even laughter the turbit has a very short andconical beak with a line of reversed feathers down the breast and ithas the habit of continually expanding slightly the upper part of theoesophagus the jacobin has the feathers so much reversed along the backof the neck that they form a hood and it has proportionally to itssize much elongated wing and tail feathers the trumpeter and laugher as their names express utter a very different coo from the otherbreeds the fantail has thirty or even forty tail feathers instead oftwelve or fourteen the normal number in all members of the great pigeonfamily and these feathers are kept expanded and are carried so erectthat in good birds the head and tail touch the oil gland is quiteaborted several other less distinct breeds might have been specified in the skeletons of the several breeds the development of the bonesof the face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously theshape as well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lowerjaw varies in a highly remarkable manner the number of the caudal andsacral vertebrae vary as does the number of the ribs together withtheir relative breadth and the presence of processes the size and shapeof the apertures in the sternum are highly variable so is the degreeof divergence and relative size of the two arms of the furcula theproportional width of the gape of mouth the proportional length of theeyelids of the orifice of the nostrils of the tongue not always instrict correlation with the length of beak the size of the crop andof the upper part of the oesophagus the development and abortion ofthe oil gland the number of the primary wing and caudal feathers therelative length of wing and tail to each other and to the body therelative length of leg and of the feet the number of scutellae onthe toes the development of skin between the toes are all points ofstructure which are variable the period at which the perfect plumage isacquired varies as does the state of the down with which the nestlingbirds are clothed when hatched the shape and size of the eggs vary themanner of flight differs remarkably as does in some breeds the voiceand disposition lastly in certain breeds the males and females havecome to differ to a slight degree from each other altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen which if shownto an ornithologist and he were told that they were wild birds wouldcertainly i think be ranked by him as well defined species moreover i do not believe that any ornithologist would place the english carrier the short faced tumbler the runt the barb pouter and fantail inthe same genus more especially as in each of these breeds severaltruly inherited sub breeds or species as he might have called them could be shown him great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons i am fullyconvinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct namely that all have descended from the rock pigeon columba livia includingunder this term several geographical races or sub species which differfrom each other in the most trifling respects as several of the reasonswhich have led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in othercases i will here briefly give them if the several breeds are notvarieties and have not proceeded from the rock pigeon they must havedescended from at least seven or eight aboriginal stocks for it isimpossible to make the present domestic breeds by the crossing of anylesser number how for instance could a pouter be produced by crossingtwo breeds unless one of the parent stocks possessed the characteristicenormous crop the supposed aboriginal stocks must all have beenrock pigeons that is not breeding or willingly perching on trees butbesides c livia with its geographical sub species only two or threeother species of rock pigeons are known and these have not any of thecharacters of the domestic breeds hence the supposed aboriginal stocksmust either still exist in the countries where they were originallydomesticated and yet be unknown to ornithologists and this considering their size habits and remarkable characters seems veryimprobable or they must have become extinct in the wild state butbirds breeding on precipices and good fliers are unlikely to beexterminated and the common rock pigeon which has the same habits withthe domestic breeds has not been exterminated even on several of thesmaller british islets or on the shores of the mediterranean hence thesupposed extermination of so many species having similar habits with therock pigeon seems to me a very rash assumption moreover the severalabove named domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts ofthe world and therefore some of them must have been carried backagain into their native country but not one has ever become wild orferal though the dovecot pigeon which is the rock pigeon in a veryslightly altered state has become feral in several places again allrecent experience shows that it is most difficult to get any wildanimal to breed freely under domestication yet on the hypothesis of themultiple origin of our pigeons it must be assumed that at least sevenor eight species were so thoroughly domesticated in ancient times byhalf civilized man as to be quite prolific under confinement an argument as it seems to me of great weight and applicable inseveral other cases is that the above specified breeds thoughagreeing generally in constitution habits voice colouring andin most parts of their structure with the wild rock pigeon yet arecertainly highly abnormal in other parts of their structure we may lookin vain throughout the whole great family of columbidae for a beak likethat of the english carrier or that of the short faced tumbler orbarb for reversed feathers like those of the jacobin for a crop likethat of the pouter for tail feathers like those of the fantail hence it must be assumed not only that half civilized man succeeded inthoroughly domesticating several species but that he intentionally orby chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species and further thatthese very species have since all become extinct or unknown so manystrange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest degree some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserveconsideration the rock pigeon is of a slaty blue and has a white rump the indian sub species c intermedia of strickland having it bluish the tail has a terminal dark bar with the bases of the outer feathersexternally edged with white the wings have two black bars somesemi domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have besidesthe two black bars the wings chequered with black these several marksdo not occur together in any other species of the whole family now inevery one of the domestic breeds taking thoroughly well bred birds allthe above marks even to the white edging of the outer tail feathers sometimes concur perfectly developed moreover when two birds belongingto two distinct breeds are crossed neither of which is blue or hasany of the above specified marks the mongrel offspring are very aptsuddenly to acquire these characters for instance i crossed someuniformly white fantails with some uniformly black barbs and theyproduced mottled brown and black birds these i again crossed together and one grandchild of the pure white fantail and pure black barb was ofas beautiful a blue colour with the white rump double black wing bar and barred and white edged tail feathers as any wild rock pigeon wecan understand these facts on the well known principle of reversion toancestral characters if all the domestic breeds have descended from therock pigeon but if we deny this we must make one of the two followinghighly improbable suppositions either firstly that all theseveral imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and marked like therock pigeon although no other existing species is thus coloured andmarked so that in each separate breed there might be a tendency torevert to the very same colours and markings or secondly that eachbreed even the purest has within a dozen or at most within a scoreof generations been crossed by the rock pigeon i say within a dozen ortwenty generations for we know of no fact countenancing the belief thatthe child ever reverts to some one ancestor removed by a greater numberof generations in a breed which has been crossed only once with somedistinct breed the tendency to reversion to any character derived fromsuch cross will naturally become less and less as in each succeedinggeneration there will be less of the foreign blood but when there hasbeen no cross with a distinct breed and there is a tendency in bothparents to revert to a character which has been lost during some formergeneration this tendency for all that we can see to the contrary maybe transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of generations these two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises oninheritance lastly the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breedsof pigeons are perfectly fertile i can state this from my ownobservations purposely made on the most distinct breeds now it isdifficult perhaps impossible to bring forward one case of the hybridoffspring of two animals clearly distinct being themselves perfectlyfertile some authors believe that long continued domesticationeliminates this strong tendency to sterility from the history of thedog i think there is some probability in this hypothesis if applied tospecies closely related together though it is unsupported by a singleexperiment but to extend the hypothesis so far as to suppose thatspecies aboriginally as distinct as carriers tumblers pouters andfantails now are should yield offspring perfectly fertile inter se seems to me rash in the extreme from these several reasons namely the improbability of man havingformerly got seven or eight supposed species of pigeons to breed freelyunder domestication these supposed species being quite unknown in awild state and their becoming nowhere feral these species having veryabnormal characters in certain respects as compared with all othercolumbidae though so like in most other respects to the rock pigeon the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all thebreeds both when kept pure and when crossed the mongrel offspringbeing perfectly fertile from these several reasons taken together ican feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from thecolumba livia with its geographical sub species in favour of this view i may add firstly that c livia or therock pigeon has been found capable of domestication in europe and inindia and that it agrees in habits and in a great number of points ofstructure with all the domestic breeds secondly although an englishcarrier or short faced tumbler differs immensely in certain charactersfrom the rock pigeon yet by comparing the several sub breeds of thesebreeds more especially those brought from distant countries wecan make an almost perfect series between the extremes of structure thirdly those characters which are mainly distinctive of each breed for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier the shortnessof that of the tumbler and the number of tail feathers in the fantail are in each breed eminently variable and the explanation of this factwill be obvious when we come to treat of selection fourthly pigeonshave been watched and tended with the utmost care and loved by manypeople they have been domesticated for thousands of years in severalquarters of the world the earliest known record of pigeons is in thefifth aegyptian dynasty about b c as was pointed out to me byprofessor lepsius but mr birch informs me that pigeons are given in abill of fare in the previous dynasty in the time of the romans as wehear from pliny immense prices were given for pigeons nay they arecome to this pass that they can reckon up their pedigree and race pigeons were much valued by akber khan in india about the year never less than pigeons were taken with the court the monarchsof iran and turan sent him some very rare birds and continues thecourtly historian his majesty by crossing the breeds which methodwas never practised before has improved them astonishingly aboutthis same period the dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the oldromans the paramount importance of these considerations in explainingthe immense amount of variation which pigeons have undergone will beobvious when we treat of selection we shall then also see how it isthat the breeds so often have a somewhat monstrous character it is alsoa most favourable circumstance for the production of distinct breeds that male and female pigeons can be easily mated for life and thusdifferent breeds can be kept together in the same aviary i have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some yet quite insufficient length because when i first kept pigeons andwatched the several kinds knowing well how true they bred i felt fullyas much difficulty in believing that they could ever have descendedfrom a common parent as any naturalist could in coming to a similarconclusion in regard to the many species of finches or other largegroups of birds in nature one circumstance has struck me much namely that all the breeders of the various domestic animals andthe cultivators of plants with whom i have ever conversed or whosetreatises i have read are firmly convinced that the several breedsto which each has attended are descended from so many aboriginallydistinct species ask as i have asked a celebrated raiser of herefordcattle whether his cattle might not have descended from long horns andhe will laugh you to scorn i have never met a pigeon or poultry orduck or rabbit fancier who was not fully convinced that each mainbreed was descended from a distinct species van mons in his treatiseon pears and apples shows how utterly he disbelieves that the severalsorts for instance a ribston pippin or codlin apple could ever haveproceeded from the seeds of the same tree innumerable other examplescould be given the explanation i think is simple from long continuedstudy they are strongly impressed with the differences between theseveral races and though they well know that each race varies slightly for they win their prizes by selecting such slight differences yet theyignore all general arguments and refuse to sum up in their minds slightdifferences accumulated during many successive generations may notthose naturalists who knowing far less of the laws of inheritance thandoes the breeder and knowing no more than he does of the intermediatelinks in the long lines of descent yet admit that many of our domesticraces have descended from the same parents may they not learn a lessonof caution when they deride the idea of species in a state of naturebeing lineal descendants of other species selection let us now briefly consider the steps by which domestic races have beenproduced either from one or from several allied species some littleeffect may perhaps be attributed to the direct action of the externalconditions of life and some little to habit but he would be a boldman who would account by such agencies for the differences of a dray andrace horse a greyhound and bloodhound a carrier and tumbler pigeon one of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races is that wesee in them adaptation not indeed to the animal s or plant s own good but to man s use or fancy some variations useful to him have probablyarisen suddenly or by one step many botanists for instance believethat the fuller s teazle with its hooks which cannot be rivalled byany mechanical contrivance is only a variety of the wild dipsacus andthis amount of change may have suddenly arisen in a seedling so it hasprobably been with the turnspit dog and this is known to have beenthe case with the ancon sheep but when we compare the dray horse andrace horse the dromedary and camel the various breeds of sheep fittedeither for cultivated land or mountain pasture with the wool of onebreed good for one purpose and that of another breed for anotherpurpose when we compare the many breeds of dogs each good for man invery different ways when we compare the game cock so pertinaciousin battle with other breeds so little quarrelsome with everlastinglayers which never desire to sit and with the bantam so small andelegant when we compare the host of agricultural culinary orchard and flower garden races of plants most useful to man at differentseasons and for different purposes or so beautiful in his eyes wemust i think look further than to mere variability we cannot supposethat all the breeds were suddenly produced as perfect and as useful aswe now see them indeed in several cases we know that this has notbeen their history the key is man s power of accumulative selection nature gives successive variations man adds them up in certaindirections useful to him in this sense he may be said to make forhimself useful breeds the great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical it is certain that several of our eminent breeders have even within asingle lifetime modified to a large extent some breeds of cattle andsheep in order fully to realise what they have done it is almostnecessary to read several of the many treatises devoted to this subject and to inspect the animals breeders habitually speak of an animal sorganisation as something quite plastic which they can model almostas they please if i had space i could quote numerous passages to thiseffect from highly competent authorities youatt who was probablybetter acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost anyother individual and who was himself a very good judge of an animal speaks of the principle of selection as that which enables theagriculturist not only to modify the character of his flock but tochange it altogether it is the magician s wand by means of whichhe may summon into life whatever form and mould he pleases lordsomerville speaking of what breeders have done for sheep says itwould seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall a form perfect initself and then had given it existence that most skilful breeder sir john sebright used to say with respect to pigeons that he wouldproduce any given feather in three years but it would take himsix years to obtain head and beak in saxony the importance of theprinciple of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised that men follow it as a trade the sheep are placed on a table and arestudied like a picture by a connoisseur this is done three times atintervals of months and the sheep are each time marked and classed sothat the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding what english breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormousprices given for animals with a good pedigree and these have now beenexported to almost every quarter of the world the improvement is by nomeans generally due to crossing different breeds all the best breedersare strongly opposed to this practice except sometimes amongst closelyallied sub breeds and when a cross has been made the closest selectionis far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases if selectionconsisted merely in separating some very distinct variety and breedingfrom it the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worthnotice but its importance consists in the great effect produced bythe accumulation in one direction during successive generations ofdifferences absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye differenceswhich i for one have vainly attempted to appreciate not one man ina thousand has accuracy of eye and judgment sufficient to become aneminent breeder if gifted with these qualities and he studies hissubject for years and devotes his lifetime to it with indomitableperseverance he will succeed and may make great improvements if hewants any of these qualities he will assuredly fail few would readilybelieve in the natural capacity and years of practice requisite tobecome even a skilful pigeon fancier the same principles are followed by horticulturists but the variationsare here often more abrupt no one supposes that our choicestproductions have been produced by a single variation from the aboriginalstock we have proofs that this is not so in some cases in which exactrecords have been kept thus to give a very trifling instance thesteadily increasing size of the common gooseberry may be quoted we seean astonishing improvement in many florists flowers when the flowersof the present day are compared with drawings made only twenty or thirtyyears ago when a race of plants is once pretty well established theseed raisers do not pick out the best plants but merely go over theirseed beds and pull up the rogues as they call the plants thatdeviate from the proper standard with animals this kind of selectionis in fact also followed for hardly any one is so careless as toallow his worst animals to breed in regard to plants there is another means of observing the accumulatedeffects of selection namely by comparing the diversity of flowers inthe different varieties of the same species in the flower garden thediversity of leaves pods or tubers or whatever part is valued in thekitchen garden in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties and the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard incomparison with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties seehow different the leaves of the cabbage are and how extremely alike theflowers how unlike the flowers of the heartsease are and how alike theleaves how much the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differin size colour shape and hairiness and yet the flowers present veryslight differences it is not that the varieties which differ largelyin some one point do not differ at all in other points this is hardlyever perhaps never the case the laws of correlation of growth the importance of which should never be overlooked will ensure somedifferences but as a general rule i cannot doubt that the continuedselection of slight variations either in the leaves the flowers orthe fruit will produce races differing from each other chiefly in thesecharacters it may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced tomethodical practice for scarcely more than three quarters of a century it has certainly been more attended to of late years and many treatiseshave been published on the subject and the result i may add has been in a corresponding degree rapid and important but it is very far fromtrue that the principle is a modern discovery i could give severalreferences to the full acknowledgment of the importance of the principlein works of high antiquity in rude and barbarous periods of englishhistory choice animals were often imported and laws were passed toprevent their exportation the destruction of horses under a certainsize was ordered and this may be compared to the roguing of plantsby nurserymen the principle of selection i find distinctly given in anancient chinese encyclopaedia explicit rules are laid down by some ofthe roman classical writers from passages in genesis it is clear thatthe colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to savages now sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals toimprove the breed and they formerly did so as is attested by passagesin pliny the savages in south africa match their draught cattle bycolour as do some of the esquimaux their teams of dogs livingstoneshows how much good domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of theinterior of africa who have not associated with europeans some of thesefacts do not show actual selection but they show that the breeding ofdomestic animals was carefully attended to in ancient times and is nowattended to by the lowest savages it would indeed have been a strangefact had attention not been paid to breeding for the inheritance ofgood and bad qualities is so obvious at the present time eminent breeders try by methodical selection witha distinct object in view to make a new strain or sub breed superiorto anything existing in the country but for our purpose a kind ofselection which may be called unconscious and which results from everyone trying to possess and breed from the best individual animals ismore important thus a man who intends keeping pointers naturally triesto get as good dogs as he can and afterwards breeds from his own bestdogs but he has no wish or expectation of permanently altering thebreed nevertheless i cannot doubt that this process continued duringcenturies would improve and modify any breed in the same way asbakewell collins etc by this very same process only carried on moremethodically did greatly modify even during their own lifetimes theforms and qualities of their cattle slow and insensible changes of thiskind could never be recognised unless actual measurements or carefuldrawings of the breeds in question had been made long ago which mightserve for comparison in some cases however unchanged or but littlechanged individuals of the same breed may be found in less civiliseddistricts where the breed has been less improved there is reason tobelieve that king charles s spaniel has been unconsciously modified toa large extent since the time of that monarch some highly competentauthorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from thespaniel and has probably been slowly altered from it it is known thatthe english pointer has been greatly changed within the last century and in this case the change has it is believed been chiefly effectedby crosses with the fox hound but what concerns us is that the changehas been effected unconsciously and gradually and yet so effectually that though the old spanish pointer certainly came from spain mr borrow has not seen as i am informed by him any native dog in spainlike our pointer by a similar process of selection and by careful training the wholebody of english racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and sizethe parent arab stock so that the latter by the regulations for thegoodwood races are favoured in the weights they carry lord spencer andothers have shown how the cattle of england have increased in weightand in early maturity compared with the stock formerly kept in thiscountry by comparing the accounts given in old pigeon treatises ofcarriers and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in britain india and persia we can i think clearly trace the stages throughwhich they have insensibly passed and come to differ so greatly fromthe rock pigeon youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course ofselection which may be considered as unconsciously followed in so farthat the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to haveproduced the result which ensued namely the production of two distinctstrains the two flocks of leicester sheep kept by mr buckley and mr burgess as mr youatt remarks have been purely bred from the originalstock of mr bakewell for upwards of fifty years there is not asuspicion existing in the mind of any one at all acquainted withthe subject that the owner of either of them has deviated in any oneinstance from the pure blood of mr bakewell s flock and yet thedifference between the sheep possessed by these two gentlemen is sogreat that they have the appearance of being quite different varieties if there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inheritedcharacter of the offspring of their domestic animals yet any one animalparticularly useful to them for any special purpose would be carefullypreserved during famines and other accidents to which savages areso liable and such choice animals would thus generally leave moreoffspring than the inferior ones so that in this case there would be akind of unconscious selection going on we see the value set on animalseven by the barbarians of tierra del fuego by their killing anddevouring their old women in times of dearth as of less value thantheir dogs in plants the same gradual process of improvement through theoccasional preservation of the best individuals whether or notsufficiently distinct to be ranked at their first appearance as distinctvarieties and whether or not two or more species or races have becomeblended together by crossing may plainly be recognised in the increasedsize and beauty which we now see in the varieties of the heartsease rose pelargonium dahlia and other plants when compared with theolder varieties or with their parent stocks no one would ever expect toget a first rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of a wild plant noone would expect to raise a first rate melting pear from the seed of awild pear though he might succeed from a poor seedling growing wild if it had come from a garden stock the pear though cultivated inclassical times appears from pliny s description to have been afruit of very inferior quality i have seen great surprise expressedin horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners in havingproduced such splendid results from such poor materials but the art i cannot doubt has been simple and as far as the final result isconcerned has been followed almost unconsciously it has consisted inalways cultivating the best known variety sowing its seeds and whena slightly better variety has chanced to appear selecting it and soonwards but the gardeners of the classical period who cultivatedthe best pear they could procure never thought what splendid fruit weshould eat though we owe our excellent fruit in some small degree to their having naturally chosen and preserved the best varieties theycould anywhere find a large amount of change in our cultivated plants thus slowly andunconsciously accumulated explains as i believe the well known fact that in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise and therefore donot know the wild parent stocks of the plants which have been longestcultivated in our flower and kitchen gardens if it has taken centuriesor thousands of years to improve or modify most of our plants up totheir present standard of usefulness to man we can understand how itis that neither australia the cape of good hope nor any other regioninhabited by quite uncivilised man has afforded us a single plant worthculture it is not that these countries so rich in species do not bya strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any useful plants butthat the native plants have not been improved by continued selection upto a standard of perfection comparable with that given to the plants incountries anciently civilised in regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man it shouldnot be overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for theirown food at least during certain seasons and in two countries verydifferently circumstanced individuals of the same species havingslightly different constitutions or structure would often succeedbetter in the one country than in the other and thus by a process of natural selection as will hereafter be more fully explained twosub breeds might be formed this perhaps partly explains what has beenremarked by some authors namely that the varieties kept by savageshave more of the character of species than the varieties kept incivilised countries on the view here given of the all important part which selection byman has played it becomes at once obvious how it is that our domesticraces show adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man swants or fancies we can i think further understand the frequentlyabnormal character of our domestic races and likewise their differencesbeing so great in external characters and relatively so slight ininternal parts or organs man can hardly select or only with muchdifficulty any deviation of structure excepting such as is externallyvisible and indeed he rarely cares for what is internal he can neveract by selection excepting on variations which are first given tohim in some slight degree by nature no man would ever try to makea fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slightdegree in an unusual manner or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with acrop of somewhat unusual size and the more abnormal or unusual anycharacter was when it first appeared the more likely it would be tocatch his attention but to use such an expression as trying to make afantail is i have no doubt in most cases utterly incorrect the manwho first selected a pigeon with a slightly larger tail never dreamedwhat the descendants of that pigeon would become through long continued partly unconscious and partly methodical selection perhaps the parentbird of all fantails had only fourteen tail feathers somewhat expanded like the present java fantail or like individuals of other and distinctbreeds in which as many as seventeen tail feathers have been counted perhaps the first pouter pigeon did not inflate its crop much more thanthe turbit now does the upper part of its oesophagus a habit whichis disregarded by all fanciers as it is not one of the points of thebreed nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure wouldbe necessary to catch the fancier s eye he perceives extremely smalldifferences and it is in human nature to value any novelty howeverslight in one s own possession nor must the value which would formerlybe set on any slight differences in the individuals of the same species be judged of by the value which would now be set on them after severalbreeds have once fairly been established many slight differences might and indeed do now arise amongst pigeons which are rejected as faultsor deviations from the standard of perfection of each breed the commongoose has not given rise to any marked varieties hence the thoulouseand the common breed which differ only in colour that most fleeting ofcharacters have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry shows i think these views further explain what has sometimes beennoticed namely that we know nothing about the origin or history ofany of our domestic breeds but in fact a breed like a dialect ofa language can hardly be said to have had a definite origin a manpreserves and breeds from an individual with some slight deviation ofstructure or takes more care than usual in matching his best animalsand thus improves them and the improved individuals slowly spread inthe immediate neighbourhood but as yet they will hardly have a distinctname and from being only slightly valued their history will bedisregarded when further improved by the same slow and gradual process they will spread more widely and will get recognised as somethingdistinct and valuable and will then probably first receive a provincialname in semi civilised countries with little free communication thespreading and knowledge of any new sub breed will be a slow process as soon as the points of value of the new sub breed are once fullyacknowledged the principle as i have called it of unconsciousselection will always tend perhaps more at one period than at another as the breed rises or falls in fashion perhaps more in one districtthan in another according to the state of civilisation of theinhabitants slowly to add to the characteristic features of the breed whatever they may be but the chance will be infinitely small of anyrecord having been preserved of such slow varying and insensiblechanges i must now say a few words on the circumstances favourable or thereverse to man s power of selection a high degree of variability isobviously favourable as freely giving the materials for selection towork on not that mere individual differences are not amply sufficient with extreme care to allow of the accumulation of a large amountof modification in almost any desired direction but as variationsmanifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally thechance of their appearance will be much increased by a large numberof individuals being kept and hence this comes to be of the highestimportance to success on this principle marshall has remarked withrespect to the sheep of parts of yorkshire that as they generallybelong to poor people and are mostly in small lots they never can beimproved on the other hand nurserymen from raising large stocksof the same plants are generally far more successful than amateurs ingetting new and valuable varieties the keeping of a large number ofindividuals of a species in any country requires that the species shouldbe placed under favourable conditions of life so as to breed freely inthat country when the individuals of any species are scanty all theindividuals whatever their quality may be will generally be allowedto breed and this will effectually prevent selection but probably themost important point of all is that the animal or plant should beso highly useful to man or so much valued by him that the closestattention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in thequalities or structure of each individual unless such attention be paidnothing can be effected i have seen it gravely remarked that it wasmost fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardenersbegan to attend closely to this plant no doubt the strawberry hadalways varied since it was cultivated but the slight varieties had beenneglected as soon however as gardeners picked out individual plantswith slightly larger earlier or better fruit and raised seedlingsfrom them and again picked out the best seedlings and bred from them then there appeared aided by some crossing with distinct species those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been raisedduring the last thirty or forty years in the case of animals with separate sexes facility in preventingcrosses is an important element of success in the formation of newraces at least in a country which is already stocked with otherraces in this respect enclosure of the land plays a part wanderingsavages or the inhabitants of open plains rarely possess more than onebreed of the same species pigeons can be mated for life and this is agreat convenience to the fancier for thus many races may be kept true though mingled in the same aviary and this circumstance must havelargely favoured the improvement and formation of new breeds pigeons i may add can be propagated in great numbers and at a very quick rate and inferior birds may be freely rejected as when killed they servefor food on the other hand cats from their nocturnal rambling habits cannot be matched and although so much valued by women and children we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up such breeds as we dosometimes see are almost always imported from some other country oftenfrom islands although i do not doubt that some domestic animals varyless than others yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of thecat the donkey peacock goose etc may be attributed in main partto selection not having been brought into play in cats from thedifficulty in pairing them in donkeys from only a few being kept bypoor people and little attention paid to their breeding in peacocks from not being very easily reared and a large stock not kept in geese from being valuable only for two purposes food and feathers and moreespecially from no pleasure having been felt in the display of distinctbreeds to sum up on the origin of our domestic races of animals and plants i believe that the conditions of life from their action on thereproductive system are so far of the highest importance as causingvariability i do not believe that variability is an inherent andnecessary contingency under all circumstances with all organic beings as some authors have thought the effects of variability are modified byvarious degrees of inheritance and of reversion variability is governedby many unknown laws more especially by that of correlation of growth something may be attributed to the direct action of the conditions oflife something must be attributed to use and disuse the final resultis thus rendered infinitely complex in some cases i do not doubtthat the intercrossing of species aboriginally distinct has played animportant part in the origin of our domestic productions when inany country several domestic breeds have once been established theiroccasional intercrossing with the aid of selection has no doubt largely aided in the formation of new sub breeds but the importance ofthe crossing of varieties has i believe been greatly exaggerated bothin regard to animals and to those plants which are propagated by seed in plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings buds etc theimportance of the crossing both of distinct species and of varietiesis immense for the cultivator here quite disregards the extremevariability both of hybrids and mongrels and the frequent sterility ofhybrids but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of littleimportance to us for their endurance is only temporary over allthese causes of change i am convinced that the accumulative actionof selection whether applied methodically and more quickly orunconsciously and more slowly but more efficiently is by far thepredominant power variation under nature variability individual differences doubtful species wide ranging much diffused and common species vary most species of the largergenera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in beingvery closely but unequally related to each other and in havingrestricted ranges before applying the principles arrived at in the last chapter to organicbeings in a state of nature we must briefly discuss whether theselatter are subject to any variation to treat this subject at allproperly a long catalogue of dry facts should be given but these ishall reserve for my future work nor shall i here discuss the variousdefinitions which have been given of the term species no one definitionhas as yet satisfied all naturalists yet every naturalist knows vaguelywhat he means when he speaks of a species generally the term includesthe unknown element of a distinct act of creation the term variety is almost equally difficult to define but here community of descent isalmost universally implied though it can rarely be proved we have alsowhat are called monstrosities but they graduate into varieties by amonstrosity i presume is meant some considerable deviation of structurein one part either injurious to or not useful to the species andnot generally propagated some authors use the term variation in atechnical sense as implying a modification directly due to the physicalconditions of life and variations in this sense are supposed not tobe inherited but who can say that the dwarfed condition of shells inthe brackish waters of the baltic or dwarfed plants on alpine summits or the thicker fur of an animal from far northwards would not in somecases be inherited for at least some few generations and in this case ipresume that the form would be called a variety again we have many slight differences which may be called individualdifferences such as are known frequently to appear in the offspringfrom the same parents or which may be presumed to have thus arisen from being frequently observed in the individuals of the same speciesinhabiting the same confined locality no one supposes that all theindividuals of the same species are cast in the very same mould theseindividual differences are highly important for us as they affordmaterials for natural selection to accumulate in the same manner asman can accumulate in any given direction individual differences in hisdomesticated productions these individual differences generally affectwhat naturalists consider unimportant parts but i could show by a longcatalogue of facts that parts which must be called important whetherviewed under a physiological or classificatory point of view sometimesvary in the individuals of the same species i am convinced that themost experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of thecases of variability even in important parts of structure which hecould collect on good authority as i have collected during a course ofyears it should be remembered that systematists are far from pleased atfinding variability in important characters and that there are notmany men who will laboriously examine internal and important organs andcompare them in many specimens of the same species i should neverhave expected that the branching of the main nerves close to the greatcentral ganglion of an insect would have been variable in the samespecies i should have expected that changes of this nature could havebeen effected only by slow degrees yet quite recently mr lubbock hasshown a degree of variability in these main nerves in coccus which mayalmost be compared to the irregular branching of the stem of a tree this philosophical naturalist i may add has also quite recently shownthat the muscles in the larvae of certain insects are very far fromuniform authors sometimes argue in a circle when they state thatimportant organs never vary for these same authors practically rankthat character as important as some few naturalists have honestlyconfessed which does not vary and under this point of view noinstance of an important part varying will ever be found but under anyother point of view many instances assuredly can be given there is one point connected with individual differences which seemsto me extremely perplexing i refer to those genera which have sometimesbeen called protean or polymorphic in which the species presentan inordinate amount of variation and hardly two naturalists can agreewhich forms to rank as species and which as varieties we may instancerubus rosa and hieracium amongst plants several genera of insects and several genera of brachiopod shells in most polymorphic generasome of the species have fixed and definite characters genera whichare polymorphic in one country seem to be with some few exceptions polymorphic in other countries and likewise judging from brachiopodshells at former periods of time these facts seem to be veryperplexing for they seem to show that this kind of variability isindependent of the conditions of life i am inclined to suspect that wesee in these polymorphic genera variations in points of structure whichare of no service or disservice to the species and which consequentlyhave not been seized on and rendered definite by natural selection ashereafter will be explained those forms which possess in some considerable degree the character ofspecies but which are so closely similar to some other forms or are soclosely linked to them by intermediate gradations that naturalists donot like to rank them as distinct species are in several respects themost important for us we have every reason to believe that many ofthese doubtful and closely allied forms have permanently retained theircharacters in their own country for a long time for as long as far aswe know as have good and true species practically when a naturalistcan unite two forms together by others having intermediate characters he treats the one as a variety of the other ranking the most common but sometimes the one first described as the species and the otheras the variety but cases of great difficulty which i will not hereenumerate sometimes occur in deciding whether or not to rank oneform as a variety of another even when they are closely connected byintermediate links nor will the commonly assumed hybrid nature of theintermediate links always remove the difficulty in very many cases however one form is ranked as a variety of another not because theintermediate links have actually been found but because analogy leadsthe observer to suppose either that they do now somewhere exist or mayformerly have existed and here a wide door for the entry of doubt andconjecture is opened hence in determining whether a form should be ranked as a species ora variety the opinion of naturalists having sound judgment and wideexperience seems the only guide to follow we must however in manycases decide by a majority of naturalists for few well marked andwell known varieties can be named which have not been ranked as speciesby at least some competent judges that varieties of this doubtful nature are far from uncommon cannot bedisputed compare the several floras of great britain of france orof the united states drawn up by different botanists and see whata surprising number of forms have been ranked by one botanist as goodspecies and by another as mere varieties mr h c watson to whom ilie under deep obligation for assistance of all kinds has marked forme british plants which are generally considered as varieties butwhich have all been ranked by botanists as species and in making thislist he has omitted many trifling varieties but which nevertheless havebeen ranked by some botanists as species and he has entirely omittedseveral highly polymorphic genera under genera including the mostpolymorphic forms mr babington gives species whereas mr benthamgives only a difference of doubtful forms amongst animalswhich unite for each birth and which are highly locomotive doubtfulforms ranked by one zoologist as a species and by another as a variety can rarely be found within the same country but are common in separatedareas how many of those birds and insects in north america and europe which differ very slightly from each other have been ranked by oneeminent naturalist as undoubted species and by another as varieties or as they are often called as geographical races many years ago when comparing and seeing others compare the birds from the separateislands of the galapagos archipelago both one with another and withthose from the american mainland i was much struck how entirely vagueand arbitrary is the distinction between species and varieties on theislets of the little madeira group there are many insects which arecharacterized as varieties in mr wollaston s admirable work butwhich it cannot be doubted would be ranked as distinct species by manyentomologists even ireland has a few animals now generally regardedas varieties but which have been ranked as species by some zoologists several most experienced ornithologists consider our british red grouseas only a strongly marked race of a norwegian species whereas thegreater number rank it as an undoubted species peculiar to greatbritain a wide distance between the homes of two doubtful forms leadsmany naturalists to rank both as distinct species but what distance ithas been well asked will suffice if that between america and europeis ample will that between the continent and the azores or madeira orthe canaries or ireland be sufficient it must be admitted that manyforms considered by highly competent judges as varieties have soperfectly the character of species that they are ranked by otherhighly competent judges as good and true species but to discuss whetherthey are rightly called species or varieties before any definition ofthese terms has been generally accepted is vainly to beat the air many of the cases of strongly marked varieties or doubtful species welldeserve consideration for several interesting lines of argument fromgeographical distribution analogical variation hybridism etc havebeen brought to bear on the attempt to determine their rank i will heregive only a single instance the well known one of the primrose andcowslip or primula veris and elatior these plants differ considerablyin appearance they have a different flavour and emit a differentodour they flower at slightly different periods they grow in somewhatdifferent stations they ascend mountains to different heights theyhave different geographical ranges and lastly according to verynumerous experiments made during several years by that most carefulobserver gartner they can be crossed only with much difficulty we could hardly wish for better evidence of the two forms beingspecifically distinct on the other hand they are united by manyintermediate links and it is very doubtful whether these links arehybrids and there is as it seems to me an overwhelming amount ofexperimental evidence showing that they descend from common parents and consequently must be ranked as varieties close investigation in most cases will bring naturalists to anagreement how to rank doubtful forms yet it must be confessed that itis in the best known countries that we find the greatest number of formsof doubtful value i have been struck with the fact that if any animalor plant in a state of nature be highly useful to man or from any causeclosely attract his attention varieties of it will almost universallybe found recorded these varieties moreover will be often ranked bysome authors as species look at the common oak how closely it hasbeen studied yet a german author makes more than a dozen species outof forms which are very generally considered as varieties and inthis country the highest botanical authorities and practical men can bequoted to show that the sessile and pedunculated oaks are either goodand distinct species or mere varieties when a young naturalist commences the study of a group of organismsquite unknown to him he is at first much perplexed to determine whatdifferences to consider as specific and what as varieties for heknows nothing of the amount and kind of variation to which the groupis subject and this shows at least how very generally there is somevariation but if he confine his attention to one class within onecountry he will soon make up his mind how to rank most of the doubtfulforms his general tendency will be to make many species for he willbecome impressed just like the pigeon or poultry fancier before alludedto with the amount of difference in the forms which he is continuallystudying and he has little general knowledge of analogical variationin other groups and in other countries by which to correct his firstimpressions as he extends the range of his observations he will meetwith more cases of difficulty for he will encounter a greater numberof closely allied forms but if his observations be widely extended hewill in the end generally be enabled to make up his own mind which tocall varieties and which species but he will succeed in this at theexpense of admitting much variation and the truth of this admissionwill often be disputed by other naturalists when moreover he comes tostudy allied forms brought from countries not now continuous in whichcase he can hardly hope to find the intermediate links between hisdoubtful forms he will have to trust almost entirely to analogy andhis difficulties will rise to a climax certainly no clear line of demarcation has as yet been drawn betweenspecies and sub species that is the forms which in the opinion of somenaturalists come very near to but do not quite arrive at the rank ofspecies or again between sub species and well marked varieties orbetween lesser varieties and individual differences these differencesblend into each other in an insensible series and a series impressesthe mind with the idea of an actual passage hence i look at individual differences though of small interest tothe systematist as of high importance for us as being the first steptowards such slight varieties as are barely thought worth recordingin works on natural history and i look at varieties which are in anydegree more distinct and permanent as steps leading to more stronglymarked and more permanent varieties and at these latter as leading tosub species and to species the passage from one stage of differenceto another and higher stage may be in some cases due merely to thelong continued action of different physical conditions in two differentregions but i have not much faith in this view and i attribute thepassage of a variety from a state in which it differs very slightlyfrom its parent to one in which it differs more to the action ofnatural selection in accumulating as will hereafter be more fullyexplained differences of structure in certain definite directions hence i believe a well marked variety may be justly called an incipientspecies but whether this belief be justifiable must be judged of bythe general weight of the several facts and views given throughout thiswork it need not be supposed that all varieties or incipient speciesnecessarily attain the rank of species they may whilst in thisincipient state become extinct or they may endure as varieties for verylong periods as has been shown to be the case by mr wollaston with thevarieties of certain fossil land shells in madeira if a variety wereto flourish so as to exceed in numbers the parent species it would thenrank as the species and the species as the variety or it might come tosupplant and exterminate the parent species or both might co exist andboth rank as independent species but we shall hereafter have to returnto this subject from these remarks it will be seen that i look at the term species as one arbitrarily given for the sake of convenience to a set ofindividuals closely resembling each other and that it does notessentially differ from the term variety which is given to lessdistinct and more fluctuating forms the term variety again in comparison with mere individual differences is also appliedarbitrarily and for mere convenience sake guided by theoretical considerations i thought that some interestingresults might be obtained in regard to the nature and relations of thespecies which vary most by tabulating all the varieties in severalwell worked floras at first this seemed a simple task but mr h c watson to whom i am much indebted for valuable advice and assistanceon this subject soon convinced me that there were many difficulties asdid subsequently dr hooker even in stronger terms i shall reservefor my future work the discussion of these difficulties and the tablesthemselves of the proportional numbers of the varying species dr hooker permits me to add that after having carefully read mymanuscript and examined the tables he thinks that the followingstatements are fairly well established the whole subject however treated as it necessarily here is with much brevity is ratherperplexing and allusions cannot be avoided to the struggle forexistence divergence of character and other questions hereafter tobe discussed alph de candolle and others have shown that plants which have very wideranges generally present varieties and this might have been expected as they become exposed to diverse physical conditions and as theycome into competition which as we shall hereafter see is a far moreimportant circumstance with different sets of organic beings but mytables further show that in any limited country the species which aremost common that is abound most in individuals and the specieswhich are most widely diffused within their own country and this is adifferent consideration from wide range and to a certain extent fromcommonness often give rise to varieties sufficiently well marked tohave been recorded in botanical works hence it is the most flourishing or as they may be called the dominant species those which rangewidely over the world are the most diffused in their own country and are the most numerous in individuals which oftenest producewell marked varieties or as i consider them incipient species andthis perhaps might have been anticipated for as varieties in orderto become in any degree permanent necessarily have to struggle with theother inhabitants of the country the species which are already dominantwill be the most likely to yield offspring which though in some slightdegree modified will still inherit those advantages that enabled theirparents to become dominant over their compatriots if the plants inhabiting a country and described in any flora be dividedinto two equal masses all those in the larger genera being placedon one side and all those in the smaller genera on the other side asomewhat larger number of the very common and much diffused or dominantspecies will be found on the side of the larger genera this again might have been anticipated for the mere fact of many species of thesame genus inhabiting any country shows that there is something in theorganic or inorganic conditions of that country favourable to the genus and consequently we might have expected to have found in the largergenera or those including many species a large proportional number ofdominant species but so many causes tend to obscure this result thati am surprised that my tables show even a small majority on the side ofthe larger genera i will here allude to only two causes of obscurity fresh water and salt loving plants have generally very wide ranges andare much diffused but this seems to be connected with the nature of thestations inhabited by them and has little or no relation to the size ofthe genera to which the species belong again plants low in the scaleof organisation are generally much more widely diffused than plantshigher in the scale and here again there is no close relation to thesize of the genera the cause of lowly organised plants ranging widelywill be discussed in our chapter on geographical distribution from looking at species as only strongly marked and well definedvarieties i was led to anticipate that the species of the larger generain each country would oftener present varieties than the species of thesmaller genera for wherever many closely related species i e speciesof the same genus have been formed many varieties or incipient speciesought as a general rule to be now forming where many large treesgrow we expect to find saplings where many species of a genus havebeen formed through variation circumstances have been favourablefor variation and hence we might expect that the circumstances wouldgenerally be still favourable to variation on the other hand if welook at each species as a special act of creation there is no apparentreason why more varieties should occur in a group having many species than in one having few to test the truth of this anticipation i have arranged the plants oftwelve countries and the coleopterous insects of two districts intotwo nearly equal masses the species of the larger genera on one side and those of the smaller genera on the other side and it has invariablyproved to be the case that a larger proportion of the species on theside of the larger genera present varieties than on the side of thesmaller genera moreover the species of the large genera which presentany varieties invariably present a larger average number of varietiesthan do the species of the small genera both these results follow whenanother division is made and when all the smallest genera with fromonly one to four species are absolutely excluded from the tables these facts are of plain signification on the view that species are onlystrongly marked and permanent varieties for wherever many species ofthe same genus have been formed or where if we may use the expression the manufactory of species has been active we ought generally to findthe manufactory still in action more especially as we have every reasonto believe the process of manufacturing new species to be a slow one and this certainly is the case if varieties be looked at as incipientspecies for my tables clearly show as a general rule that wherevermany species of a genus have been formed the species of that genuspresent a number of varieties that is of incipient species beyond theaverage it is not that all large genera are now varying much and arethus increasing in the number of their species or that no small generaare now varying and increasing for if this had been so it would havebeen fatal to my theory inasmuch as geology plainly tells us that smallgenera have in the lapse of time often increased greatly in size and that large genera have often come to their maxima declined anddisappeared all that we want to show is that where many species of agenus have been formed on an average many are still forming and thisholds good there are other relations between the species of large genera and theirrecorded varieties which deserve notice we have seen that there is noinfallible criterion by which to distinguish species and well markedvarieties and in those cases in which intermediate links have not beenfound between doubtful forms naturalists are compelled to come toa determination by the amount of difference between them judging byanalogy whether or not the amount suffices to raise one or both to therank of species hence the amount of difference is one very importantcriterion in settling whether two forms should be ranked as species orvarieties now fries has remarked in regard to plants and westwood inregard to insects that in large genera the amount of difference betweenthe species is often exceedingly small i have endeavoured to test thisnumerically by averages and as far as my imperfect results go theyalways confirm the view i have also consulted some sagacious and mostexperienced observers and after deliberation they concur in thisview in this respect therefore the species of the larger generaresemble varieties more than do the species of the smaller genera or the case may be put in another way and it may be said that inthe larger genera in which a number of varieties or incipient speciesgreater than the average are now manufacturing many of the speciesalready manufactured still to a certain extent resemble varieties forthey differ from each other by a less than usual amount of difference moreover the species of the large genera are related to each other inthe same manner as the varieties of any one species are related toeach other no naturalist pretends that all the species of a genus areequally distinct from each other they may generally be divided intosub genera or sections or lesser groups as fries has well remarked little groups of species are generally clustered like satellites aroundcertain other species and what are varieties but groups of forms unequally related to each other and clustered round certain forms thatis round their parent species undoubtedly there is one most importantpoint of difference between varieties and species namely that theamount of difference between varieties when compared with each other orwith their parent species is much less than that between the species ofthe same genus but when we come to discuss the principle as i call it of divergence of character we shall see how this may be explained andhow the lesser differences between varieties will tend to increase intothe greater differences between species there is one other point which seems to me worth notice varietiesgenerally have much restricted ranges this statement is indeed scarcelymore than a truism for if a variety were found to have a wider rangethan that of its supposed parent species their denominations ought tobe reversed but there is also reason to believe that those specieswhich are very closely allied to other species and in so far resemblevarieties often have much restricted ranges for instance mr h c watson has marked for me in the well sifted london catalogue of plants th edition plants which are therein ranked as species but whichhe considers as so closely allied to other species as to be of doubtfulvalue these reputed species range on an average over of theprovinces into which mr watson has divided great britain now in thissame catalogue acknowledged varieties are recorded and these rangeover provinces whereas the species to which these varieties belongrange over provinces so that the acknowledged varieties have verynearly the same restricted average range as have those very closelyallied forms marked for me by mr watson as doubtful species but whichare almost universally ranked by british botanists as good and truespecies finally then varieties have the same general characters as species for they cannot be distinguished from species except firstly bythe discovery of intermediate linking forms and the occurrence ofsuch links cannot affect the actual characters of the forms which theyconnect and except secondly by a certain amount of difference fortwo forms if differing very little are generally ranked as varieties notwithstanding that intermediate linking forms have not beendiscovered but the amount of difference considered necessary to give totwo forms the rank of species is quite indefinite in genera having morethan the average number of species in any country the species of thesegenera have more than the average number of varieties in large generathe species are apt to be closely but unequally allied together forming little clusters round certain species species very closelyallied to other species apparently have restricted ranges in all theseseveral respects the species of large genera present a strong analogywith varieties and we can clearly understand these analogies ifspecies have once existed as varieties and have thus originated whereas these analogies are utterly inexplicable if each species hasbeen independently created we have also seen that it is the most flourishing and dominant speciesof the larger genera which on an average vary most and varieties aswe shall hereafter see tend to become converted into new and distinctspecies the larger genera thus tend to become larger and throughoutnature the forms of life which are now dominant tend to become stillmore dominant by leaving many modified and dominant descendants but bysteps hereafter to be explained the larger genera also tend to break upinto smaller genera and thus the forms of life throughout the universebecome divided into groups subordinate to groups struggle for existence bears on natural selection the term used in a wide sense geometricalpowers of increase rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants nature of the checks to increase competition universal effects ofclimate protection from the number of individuals complex relations ofall animals and plants throughout nature struggle for life most severebetween individuals and varieties of the same species often severebetween species of the same genus the relation of organism to organismthe most important of all relations before entering on the subject of this chapter i must make a fewpreliminary remarks to show how the struggle for existence bears onnatural selection it has been seen in the last chapter thatamongst organic beings in a state of nature there is some individualvariability indeed i am not aware that this has ever been disputed it is immaterial for us whether a multitude of doubtful forms be calledspecies or sub species or varieties what rank for instance the two orthree hundred doubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold if the existence of any well marked varieties be admitted but themere existence of individual variability and of some few well markedvarieties though necessary as the foundation for the work helps us butlittle in understanding how species arise in nature how have all thoseexquisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part and to the conditions of life and of one distinct organic being toanother being been perfected we see these beautiful co adaptationsmost plainly in the woodpecker and missletoe and only a littleless plainly in the humblest parasite which clings to the hairs of aquadruped or feathers of a bird in the structure of the beetle whichdives through the water in the plumed seed which is wafted by thegentlest breeze in short we see beautiful adaptations everywhere andin every part of the organic world again it may be asked how is it that varieties which i have calledincipient species become ultimately converted into good and distinctspecies which in most cases obviously differ from each other farmore than do the varieties of the same species how do those groups ofspecies which constitute what are called distinct genera and whichdiffer from each other more than do the species of the same genus arise all these results as we shall more fully see in the nextchapter follow inevitably from the struggle for life owing to thisstruggle for life any variation however slight and from whatever causeproceeding if it be in any degree profitable to an individual of anyspecies in its infinitely complex relations to other organic beings andto external nature will tend to the preservation of that individual and will generally be inherited by its offspring the offspring also will thus have a better chance of surviving for of the manyindividuals of any species which are periodically born but a smallnumber can survive i have called this principle by which each slightvariation if useful is preserved by the term of natural selection in order to mark its relation to man s power of selection we have seenthat man by selection can certainly produce great results and can adaptorganic beings to his own uses through the accumulation of slightbut useful variations given to him by the hand of nature but naturalselection as we shall hereafter see is a power incessantly ready foraction and is as immeasurably superior to man s feeble efforts as theworks of nature are to those of art we will now discuss in a little more detail the struggle for existence in my future work this subject shall be treated as it well deserves at much greater length the elder de candolle and lyell have largelyand philosophically shown that all organic beings are exposed to severecompetition in regard to plants no one has treated this subject withmore spirit and ability than w herbert dean of manchester evidentlythe result of his great horticultural knowledge nothing is easier thanto admit in words the truth of the universal struggle for life or moredifficult at least i have found it so than constantly to bear thisconclusion in mind yet unless it be thoroughly engrained in the mind i am convinced that the whole economy of nature with every fact ondistribution rarity abundance extinction and variation will bedimly seen or quite misunderstood we behold the face of nature brightwith gladness we often see superabundance of food we do not see orwe forget that the birds which are idly singing round us mostly live oninsects or seeds and are thus constantly destroying life or we forgethow largely these songsters or their eggs or their nestlings aredestroyed by birds and beasts of prey we do not always bear in mind that though food may be now superabundant it is not so at all seasonsof each recurring year i should premise that i use the term struggle for existence in a largeand metaphorical sense including dependence of one being on another and including which is more important not only the life of theindividual but success in leaving progeny two canine animals in a timeof dearth may be truly said to struggle with each other which shall getfood and live but a plant on the edge of a desert is said to strugglefor life against the drought though more properly it should be said tobe dependent on the moisture a plant which annually produces a thousandseeds of which on an average only one comes to maturity may be moretruly said to struggle with the plants of the same and other kinds whichalready clothe the ground the missletoe is dependent on the apple and afew other trees but can only in a far fetched sense be said to strugglewith these trees for if too many of these parasites grow on the sametree it will languish and die but several seedling missletoes growingclose together on the same branch may more truly be said to strugglewith each other as the missletoe is disseminated by birds itsexistence depends on birds and it may metaphorically be said tostruggle with other fruit bearing plants in order to tempt birds todevour and thus disseminate its seeds rather than those of otherplants in these several senses which pass into each other i use forconvenience sake the general term of struggle for existence a struggle for existence inevitably follows from the high rate at whichall organic beings tend to increase every being which during itsnatural lifetime produces several eggs or seeds must suffer destructionduring some period of its life and during some season or occasionalyear otherwise on the principle of geometrical increase its numberswould quickly become so inordinately great that no country could supportthe product hence as more individuals are produced than can possiblysurvive there must in every case be a struggle for existence eitherone individual with another of the same species or with the individualsof distinct species or with the physical conditions of life it is thedoctrine of malthus applied with manifold force to the whole animal andvegetable kingdoms for in this case there can be no artificial increaseof food and no prudential restraint from marriage although somespecies may be now increasing more or less rapidly in numbers allcannot do so for the world would not hold them there is no exception to the rule that every organic being naturallyincreases at so high a rate that if not destroyed the earth would soonbe covered by the progeny of a single pair even slow breeding man hasdoubled in twenty five years and at this rate in a few thousand years there would literally not be standing room for his progeny linnaeus hascalculated that if an annual plant produced only two seeds and there isno plant so unproductive as this and their seedlings next year producedtwo and so on then in twenty years there would be a million plants the elephant is reckoned to be the slowest breeder of all known animals and i have taken some pains to estimate its probable minimum rate ofnatural increase it will be under the mark to assume that it breedswhen thirty years old and goes on breeding till ninety years old bringing forth three pair of young in this interval if this be so at the end of the fifth century there would be alive fifteen millionelephants descended from the first pair but we have better evidence on this subject than mere theoreticalcalculations namely the numerous recorded cases of the astonishinglyrapid increase of various animals in a state of nature whencircumstances have been favourable to them during two or three followingseasons still more striking is the evidence from our domestic animalsof many kinds which have run wild in several parts of the world if thestatements of the rate of increase of slow breeding cattle and horsesin south america and latterly in australia had not been wellauthenticated they would have been quite incredible so it is withplants cases could be given of introduced plants which have becomecommon throughout whole islands in a period of less than ten years several of the plants now most numerous over the wide plains of laplata clothing square leagues of surface almost to the exclusion ofall other plants have been introduced from europe and there are plantswhich now range in india as i hear from dr falconer from capecomorin to the himalaya which have been imported from america since itsdiscovery in such cases and endless instances could be given no onesupposes that the fertility of these animals or plants has beensuddenly and temporarily increased in any sensible degree the obviousexplanation is that the conditions of life have been very favourable and that there has consequently been less destruction of the old andyoung and that nearly all the young have been enabled to breed in suchcases the geometrical ratio of increase the result of which never failsto be surprising simply explains the extraordinarily rapid increase andwide diffusion of naturalised productions in their new homes in a state of nature almost every plant produces seed and amongstanimals there are very few which do not annually pair hence we mayconfidently assert that all plants and animals are tending to increaseat a geometrical ratio that all would most rapidly stock every stationin which they could any how exist and that the geometrical tendencyto increase must be checked by destruction at some period of life ourfamiliarity with the larger domestic animals tends i think to misleadus we see no great destruction falling on them and we forget thatthousands are annually slaughtered for food and that in a state ofnature an equal number would have somehow to be disposed of the only difference between organisms which annually produce eggs orseeds by the thousand and those which produce extremely few is that the slow breeders would require a few more years to people underfavourable conditions a whole district let it be ever so large thecondor lays a couple of eggs and the ostrich a score and yet in thesame country the condor may be the more numerous of the two the fulmarpetrel lays but one egg yet it is believed to be the most numerous birdin the world one fly deposits hundreds of eggs and another like thehippobosca a single one but this difference does not determine howmany individuals of the two species can be supported in a district a large number of eggs is of some importance to those species whichdepend on a rapidly fluctuating amount of food for it allows themrapidly to increase in number but the real importance of a large numberof eggs or seeds is to make up for much destruction at some period oflife and this period in the great majority of cases is an early one ifan animal can in any way protect its own eggs or young a small numbermay be produced and yet the average stock be fully kept up but if manyeggs or young are destroyed many must be produced or the species willbecome extinct it would suffice to keep up the full number of a tree which lived on an average for a thousand years if a single seed wereproduced once in a thousand years supposing that this seed were neverdestroyed and could be ensured to germinate in a fitting place so thatin all cases the average number of any animal or plant depends onlyindirectly on the number of its eggs or seeds in looking at nature it is most necessary to keep the foregoingconsiderations always in mind never to forget that every single organicbeing around us may be said to be striving to the utmost to increase innumbers that each lives by a struggle at some period of its life thatheavy destruction inevitably falls either on the young or old duringeach generation or at recurrent intervals lighten any check mitigatethe destruction ever so little and the number of the species willalmost instantaneously increase to any amount the face of nature maybe compared to a yielding surface with ten thousand sharp wedges packedclose together and driven inwards by incessant blows sometimes onewedge being struck and then another with greater force what checks the natural tendency of each species to increase in numberis most obscure look at the most vigorous species by as much as itswarms in numbers by so much will its tendency to increase be stillfurther increased we know not exactly what the checks are in evenone single instance nor will this surprise any one who reflects howignorant we are on this head even in regard to mankind so incomparablybetter known than any other animal this subject has been ably treatedby several authors and i shall in my future work discuss some of thechecks at considerable length more especially in regard to the feralanimals of south america here i will make only a few remarks just torecall to the reader s mind some of the chief points eggs or very younganimals seem generally to suffer most but this is not invariably thecase with plants there is a vast destruction of seeds but from someobservations which i have made i believe that it is the seedlings whichsuffer most from germinating in ground already thickly stocked withother plants seedlings also are destroyed in vast numbers by variousenemies for instance on a piece of ground three feet long and twowide dug and cleared and where there could be no choking from otherplants i marked all the seedlings of our native weeds as they came up and out of the no less than were destroyed chiefly by slugsand insects if turf which has long been mown and the case would be thesame with turf closely browsed by quadrupeds be let to grow the morevigorous plants gradually kill the less vigorous though fully grown plants thus out of twenty species growing on a little plot of turf three feet by four nine species perished from the other species beingallowed to grow up freely the amount of food for each species of course gives the extreme limitto which each can increase but very frequently it is not the obtainingfood but the serving as prey to other animals which determines theaverage numbers of a species thus there seems to be little doubt thatthe stock of partridges grouse and hares on any large estate dependschiefly on the destruction of vermin if not one head of game were shotduring the next twenty years in england and at the same time if novermin were destroyed there would in all probability be less gamethan at present although hundreds of thousands of game animals are nowannually killed on the other hand in some cases as with the elephantand rhinoceros none are destroyed by beasts of prey even the tiger inindia most rarely dares to attack a young elephant protected by its dam climate plays an important part in determining the average numbers of aspecies and periodical seasons of extreme cold or drought i believeto be the most effective of all checks i estimated that the winter of destroyed four fifths of the birds in my own grounds and thisis a tremendous destruction when we remember that ten per cent is anextraordinarily severe mortality from epidemics with man the action ofclimate seems at first sight to be quite independent of the struggle forexistence but in so far as climate chiefly acts in reducing food itbrings on the most severe struggle between the individuals whether ofthe same or of distinct species which subsist on the same kind of food even when climate for instance extreme cold acts directly it willbe the least vigorous or those which have got least food through theadvancing winter which will suffer most when we travel from south tonorth or from a damp region to a dry we invariably see some speciesgradually getting rarer and rarer and finally disappearing and thechange of climate being conspicuous we are tempted to attribute thewhole effect to its direct action but this is a very false view weforget that each species even where it most abounds is constantlysuffering enormous destruction at some period of its life from enemiesor from competitors for the same place and food and if these enemiesor competitors be in the least degree favoured by any slight change ofclimate they will increase in numbers and as each area is alreadyfully stocked with inhabitants the other species will decrease whenwe travel southward and see a species decreasing in numbers we may feelsure that the cause lies quite as much in other species being favoured as in this one being hurt so it is when we travel northward but ina somewhat lesser degree for the number of species of all kinds and therefore of competitors decreases northwards hence in goingnorthward or in ascending a mountain we far oftener meet with stuntedforms due to the directly injurious action of climate than we do inproceeding southwards or in descending a mountain when we reachthe arctic regions or snow capped summits or absolute deserts thestruggle for life is almost exclusively with the elements that climate acts in main part indirectly by favouring other species wemay clearly see in the prodigious number of plants in our gardenswhich can perfectly well endure our climate but which never becomenaturalised for they cannot compete with our native plants nor resistdestruction by our native animals when a species owing to highly favourable circumstances increasesinordinately in numbers in a small tract epidemics at least thisseems generally to occur with our game animals often ensue and herewe have a limiting check independent of the struggle for life but evensome of these so called epidemics appear to be due to parasitic worms which have from some cause possibly in part through facility ofdiffusion amongst the crowded animals been disproportionably favoured and here comes in a sort of struggle between the parasite and its prey on the other hand in many cases a large stock of individuals of thesame species relatively to the numbers of its enemies is absolutelynecessary for its preservation thus we can easily raise plenty ofcorn and rape seed etc in our fields because the seeds are in greatexcess compared with the number of birds which feed on them nor canthe birds though having a superabundance of food at this one season increase in number proportionally to the supply of seed as theirnumbers are checked during winter but any one who has tried knows howtroublesome it is to get seed from a few wheat or other such plants ina garden i have in this case lost every single seed this view of thenecessity of a large stock of the same species for its preservation explains i believe some singular facts in nature such as that of veryrare plants being sometimes extremely abundant in the few spots wherethey do occur and that of some social plants being social that is abounding in individuals even on the extreme confines of their range for in such cases we may believe that a plant could exist only wherethe conditions of its life were so favourable that many could existtogether and thus save each other from utter destruction i should addthat the good effects of frequent intercrossing and the ill effects ofclose interbreeding probably come into play in some of these cases buton this intricate subject i will not here enlarge many cases are on record showing how complex and unexpected are thechecks and relations between organic beings which have to struggletogether in the same country i will give only a single instance which though a simple one has interested me in staffordshire on the estateof a relation where i had ample means of investigation there was alarge and extremely barren heath which had never been touched by thehand of man but several hundred acres of exactly the same nature hadbeen enclosed twenty five years previously and planted with scotch fir the change in the native vegetation of the planted part of the heath wasmost remarkable more than is generally seen in passing from one quitedifferent soil to another not only the proportional numbers of theheath plants were wholly changed but twelve species of plants notcounting grasses and carices flourished in the plantations which couldnot be found on the heath the effect on the insects must have beenstill greater for six insectivorous birds were very common in theplantations which were not to be seen on the heath and the heath wasfrequented by two or three distinct insectivorous birds here we see howpotent has been the effect of the introduction of a single tree nothingwhatever else having been done with the exception that the land hadbeen enclosed so that cattle could not enter but how important anelement enclosure is i plainly saw near farnham in surrey herethere are extensive heaths with a few clumps of old scotch firs onthe distant hill tops within the last ten years large spaces have beenenclosed and self sown firs are now springing up in multitudes soclose together that all cannot live when i ascertained that these young trees had not been sown or planted i was so much surprised at their numbers that i went to several pointsof view whence i could examine hundreds of acres of the unenclosedheath and literally i could not see a single scotch fir except the oldplanted clumps but on looking closely between the stems of the heath i found a multitude of seedlings and little trees which had beenperpetually browsed down by the cattle in one square yard at apoint some hundred yards distant from one of the old clumps i countedthirty two little trees and one of them judging from the rings ofgrowth had during twenty six years tried to raise its head above thestems of the heath and had failed no wonder that as soon as the landwas enclosed it became thickly clothed with vigorously growing youngfirs yet the heath was so extremely barren and so extensive that noone would ever have imagined that cattle would have so closely andeffectually searched it for food here we see that cattle absolutely determine the existence of the scotchfir but in several parts of the world insects determine the existenceof cattle perhaps paraguay offers the most curious instance of this for here neither cattle nor horses nor dogs have ever run wild thoughthey swarm southward and northward in a feral state and azara andrengger have shown that this is caused by the greater number in paraguayof a certain fly which lays its eggs in the navels of these animalswhen first born the increase of these flies numerous as they are must be habitually checked by some means probably by birds hence ifcertain insectivorous birds whose numbers are probably regulated byhawks or beasts of prey were to increase in paraguay the flies woulddecrease then cattle and horses would become feral and this wouldcertainly greatly alter as indeed i have observed in parts of southamerica the vegetation this again would largely affect the insects and this as we just have seen in staffordshire the insectivorousbirds and so onwards in ever increasing circles of complexity we beganthis series by insectivorous birds and we have ended with them notthat in nature the relations can ever be as simple as this battlewithin battle must ever be recurring with varying success and yet inthe long run the forces are so nicely balanced that the face of natureremains uniform for long periods of time though assuredly the meresttrifle would often give the victory to one organic being over another nevertheless so profound is our ignorance and so high our presumption that we marvel when we hear of the extinction of an organic being andas we do not see the cause we invoke cataclysms to desolate the world or invent laws on the duration of the forms of life i am tempted to give one more instance showing how plants and animals most remote in the scale of nature are bound together by a web ofcomplex relations i shall hereafter have occasion to show that theexotic lobelia fulgens in this part of england is never visited byinsects and consequently from its peculiar structure never can set aseed many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits ofmoths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them ihave also reason to believe that humble bees are indispensable to thefertilisation of the heartsease viola tricolor for other bees do notvisit this flower from experiments which i have tried i have foundthat the visits of bees if not indispensable are at least highlybeneficial to the fertilisation of our clovers but humble bees alonevisit the common red clover trifolium pratense as other bees cannotreach the nectar hence i have very little doubt that if the wholegenus of humble bees became extinct or very rare in england theheartsease and red clover would become very rare or wholly disappear the number of humble bees in any district depends in a great degree onthe number of field mice which destroy their combs and nests and mr h newman who has long attended to the habits of humble bees believesthat more than two thirds of them are thus destroyed all over england now the number of mice is largely dependent as every one knows on thenumber of cats and mr newman says near villages and small towns ihave found the nests of humble bees more numerous than elsewhere whichi attribute to the number of cats that destroy the mice hence it isquite credible that the presence of a feline animal in large numbers ina district might determine through the intervention first of mice andthen of bees the frequency of certain flowers in that district in the case of every species many different checks acting at differentperiods of life and during different seasons or years probably comeinto play some one check or some few being generally the most potent but all concurring in determining the average number or eventhe existence of the species in some cases it can be shown thatwidely different checks act on the same species in different districts when we look at the plants and bushes clothing an entangled bank weare tempted to attribute their proportional numbers and kinds to what wecall chance but how false a view is this every one has heard that whenan american forest is cut down a very different vegetation springsup but it has been observed that the trees now growing on the ancientindian mounds in the southern united states display the same beautifuldiversity and proportion of kinds as in the surrounding virgin forests what a struggle between the several kinds of trees must here have goneon during long centuries each annually scattering its seeds by thethousand what war between insect and insect between insects snails and other animals with birds and beasts of prey all striving toincrease and all feeding on each other or on the trees or their seedsand seedlings or on the other plants which first clothed the ground andthus checked the growth of the trees throw up a handful of feathers and all must fall to the ground according to definite laws but howsimple is this problem compared to the action and reaction of theinnumerable plants and animals which have determined in the course ofcenturies the proportional numbers and kinds of trees now growing onthe old indian ruins the dependency of one organic being on another as of a parasite on itsprey lies generally between beings remote in the scale of nature thisis often the case with those which may strictly be said to struggle witheach other for existence as in the case of locusts and grass feedingquadrupeds but the struggle almost invariably will be most severebetween the individuals of the same species for they frequent the samedistricts require the same food and are exposed to the same dangers in the case of varieties of the same species the struggle willgenerally be almost equally severe and we sometimes see the contestsoon decided for instance if several varieties of wheat be sowntogether and the mixed seed be resown some of the varieties which bestsuit the soil or climate or are naturally the most fertile will beatthe others and so yield more seed and will consequently in a few yearsquite supplant the other varieties to keep up a mixed stock of evensuch extremely close varieties as the variously coloured sweet peas they must be each year harvested separately and the seed then mixedin due proportion otherwise the weaker kinds will steadily decrease innumbers and disappear so again with the varieties of sheep it hasbeen asserted that certain mountain varieties will starve out othermountain varieties so that they cannot be kept together the sameresult has followed from keeping together different varieties of themedicinal leech it may even be doubted whether the varieties of anyone of our domestic plants or animals have so exactly the same strength habits and constitution that the original proportions of a mixed stockcould be kept up for half a dozen generations if they were allowed tostruggle together like beings in a state of nature and if the seed oryoung were not annually sorted as species of the same genus have usually though by no meansinvariably some similarity in habits and constitution and always instructure the struggle will generally be more severe between speciesof the same genus when they come into competition with each other thanbetween species of distinct genera we see this in the recent extensionover parts of the united states of one species of swallow havingcaused the decrease of another species the recent increase of themissel thrush in parts of scotland has caused the decrease of thesong thrush how frequently we hear of one species of rat taking theplace of another species under the most different climates in russiathe small asiatic cockroach has everywhere driven before it its greatcongener one species of charlock will supplant another and so inother cases we can dimly see why the competition should be most severebetween allied forms which fill nearly the same place in the economyof nature but probably in no one case could we precisely say why onespecies has been victorious over another in the great battle of life a corollary of the highest importance may be deduced from the foregoingremarks namely that the structure of every organic being is related in the most essential yet often hidden manner to that of all otherorganic beings with which it comes into competition for food orresidence or from which it has to escape or on which it preys thisis obvious in the structure of the teeth and talons of the tiger and inthat of the legs and claws of the parasite which clings to the hair onthe tiger s body but in the beautifully plumed seed of the dandelion and in the flattened and fringed legs of the water beetle the relationseems at first confined to the elements of air and water yet theadvantage of plumed seeds no doubt stands in the closest relation to theland being already thickly clothed by other plants so that theseeds may be widely distributed and fall on unoccupied ground in thewater beetle the structure of its legs so well adapted for diving allows it to compete with other aquatic insects to hunt for its ownprey and to escape serving as prey to other animals the store of nutriment laid up within the seeds of many plants seems atfirst sight to have no sort of relation to other plants but from thestrong growth of young plants produced from such seeds as peas andbeans when sown in the midst of long grass i suspect that the chiefuse of the nutriment in the seed is to favour the growth of the youngseedling whilst struggling with other plants growing vigorously allaround look at a plant in the midst of its range why does it not double orquadruple its numbers we know that it can perfectly well withstand alittle more heat or cold dampness or dryness for elsewhere it rangesinto slightly hotter or colder damper or drier districts in this casewe can clearly see that if we wished in imagination to give the plantthe power of increasing in number we should have to give it someadvantage over its competitors or over the animals which preyed on it on the confines of its geographical range a change of constitution withrespect to climate would clearly be an advantage to our plant but wehave reason to believe that only a few plants or animals range so far that they are destroyed by the rigour of the climate alone not untilwe reach the extreme confines of life in the arctic regions or on theborders of an utter desert will competition cease the land may beextremely cold or dry yet there will be competition between some fewspecies or between the individuals of the same species for the warmestor dampest spots hence also we can see that when a plant or animal is placed in a newcountry amongst new competitors though the climate may be exactlythe same as in its former home yet the conditions of its life willgenerally be changed in an essential manner if we wished to increaseits average numbers in its new home we should have to modify it in adifferent way to what we should have done in its native country forwe should have to give it some advantage over a different set ofcompetitors or enemies it is good thus to try in our imagination to give any form someadvantage over another probably in no single instance should we knowwhat to do so as to succeed it will convince us of our ignorance onthe mutual relations of all organic beings a conviction as necessary as it seems to be difficult to acquire all that we can do is to keepsteadily in mind that each organic being is striving to increase at ageometrical ratio that each at some period of its life during someseason of the year during each generation or at intervals has tostruggle for life and to suffer great destruction when we reflect onthis struggle we may console ourselves with the full belief that thewar of nature is not incessant that no fear is felt that death isgenerally prompt and that the vigorous the healthy and the happysurvive and multiply natural selection natural selection its power compared with man s selection its poweron characters of trifling importance its power at all ages and onboth sexes sexual selection on the generality of intercrossesbetween individuals of the same species circumstances favourable andunfavourable to natural selection namely intercrossing isolation number of individuals slow action extinction caused by naturalselection divergence of character related to the diversity ofinhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation action of naturalselection through divergence of character and extinction on thedescendants from a common parent explains the grouping of all organicbeings how will the struggle for existence discussed too briefly in the lastchapter act in regard to variation can the principle of selection which we have seen is so potent in the hands of man apply in nature ithink we shall see that it can act most effectually let it be bornein mind in what an endless number of strange peculiarities our domesticproductions and in a lesser degree those under nature vary and howstrong the hereditary tendency is under domestication it may be trulysaid that the whole organisation becomes in some degree plastic let itbe borne in mind how infinitely complex and close fitting are the mutualrelations of all organic beings to each other and to their physicalconditions of life can it then be thought improbable seeingthat variations useful to man have undoubtedly occurred that othervariations useful in some way to each being in the great and complexbattle of life should sometimes occur in the course of thousands ofgenerations if such do occur can we doubt remembering that many moreindividuals are born than can possibly survive that individuals havingany advantage however slight over others would have the best chanceof surviving and of procreating their kind on the other hand we mayfeel sure that any variation in the least degree injurious would berigidly destroyed this preservation of favourable variations and therejection of injurious variations i call natural selection variationsneither useful nor injurious would not be affected by natural selection and would be left a fluctuating element as perhaps we see in thespecies called polymorphic we shall best understand the probable course of natural selectionby taking the case of a country undergoing some physical change forinstance of climate the proportional numbers of its inhabitants wouldalmost immediately undergo a change and some species might becomeextinct we may conclude from what we have seen of the intimate andcomplex manner in which the inhabitants of each country are boundtogether that any change in the numerical proportions of some of theinhabitants independently of the change of climate itself would mostseriously affect many of the others if the country were open on itsborders new forms would certainly immigrate and this also wouldseriously disturb the relations of some of the former inhabitants letit be remembered how powerful the influence of a single introduced treeor mammal has been shown to be but in the case of an island or of acountry partly surrounded by barriers into which new and better adaptedforms could not freely enter we should then have places in the economyof nature which would assuredly be better filled up if some of theoriginal inhabitants were in some manner modified for had the areabeen open to immigration these same places would have been seized on byintruders in such case every slight modification which in the courseof ages chanced to arise and which in any way favoured the individualsof any of the species by better adapting them to their alteredconditions would tend to be preserved and natural selection would thushave free scope for the work of improvement we have reason to believe as stated in the first chapter that a changein the conditions of life by specially acting on the reproductivesystem causes or increases variability and in the foregoing case theconditions of life are supposed to have undergone a change and thiswould manifestly be favourable to natural selection by giving abetter chance of profitable variations occurring and unless profitablevariations do occur natural selection can do nothing not that asi believe any extreme amount of variability is necessary as man cancertainly produce great results by adding up in any given directionmere individual differences so could nature but far more easily fromhaving incomparably longer time at her disposal nor do i believe thatany great physical change as of climate or any unusual degree ofisolation to check immigration is actually necessary to produce newand unoccupied places for natural selection to fill up by modifying andimproving some of the varying inhabitants for as all the inhabitantsof each country are struggling together with nicely balanced forces extremely slight modifications in the structure or habits of oneinhabitant would often give it an advantage over others and stillfurther modifications of the same kind would often still furtherincrease the advantage no country can be named in which all the nativeinhabitants are now so perfectly adapted to each other and to thephysical conditions under which they live that none of them couldanyhow be improved for in all countries the natives have been so farconquered by naturalised productions that they have allowed foreignersto take firm possession of the land and as foreigners have thuseverywhere beaten some of the natives we may safely conclude that thenatives might have been modified with advantage so as to have betterresisted such intruders as man can produce and certainly has produced a great result by hismethodical and unconscious means of selection what may not natureeffect man can act only on external and visible characters naturecares nothing for appearances except in so far as they may be usefulto any being she can act on every internal organ on every shade ofconstitutional difference on the whole machinery of life man selectsonly for his own good nature only for that of the being which shetends every selected character is fully exercised by her and the beingis placed under well suited conditions of life man keeps the nativesof many climates in the same country he seldom exercises each selectedcharacter in some peculiar and fitting manner he feeds a long and ashort beaked pigeon on the same food he does not exercise a long backedor long legged quadruped in any peculiar manner he exposes sheep withlong and short wool to the same climate he does not allow the mostvigorous males to struggle for the females he does not rigidly destroyall inferior animals but protects during each varying season as far aslies in his power all his productions he often begins his selectionby some half monstrous form or at least by some modification prominentenough to catch his eye or to be plainly useful to him under nature the slightest difference of structure or constitution may well turn thenicely balanced scale in the struggle for life and so be preserved how fleeting are the wishes and efforts of man how short his time and consequently how poor will his products be compared with thoseaccumulated by nature during whole geological periods can we wonder then that nature s productions should be far truer in character thanman s productions that they should be infinitely better adapted to themost complex conditions of life and should plainly bear the stamp offar higher workmanship it may be said that natural selection is daily and hourly scrutinising throughout the world every variation even the slightest rejectingthat which is bad preserving and adding up all that is good silentlyand insensibly working whenever and wherever opportunity offers atthe improvement of each organic being in relation to its organic andinorganic conditions of life we see nothing of these slow changes inprogress until the hand of time has marked the long lapse of ages andthen so imperfect is our view into long past geological ages thatwe only see that the forms of life are now different from what theyformerly were although natural selection can act only through and for the good of eachbeing yet characters and structures which we are apt to consider as ofvery trifling importance may thus be acted on when we see leaf eatinginsects green and bark feeders mottled grey the alpine ptarmigan whitein winter the red grouse the colour of heather and the black grousethat of peaty earth we must believe that these tints are of service tothese birds and insects in preserving them from danger grouse if notdestroyed at some period of their lives would increase in countlessnumbers they are known to suffer largely from birds of prey and hawksare guided by eyesight to their prey so much so that on parts of thecontinent persons are warned not to keep white pigeons as being themost liable to destruction hence i can see no reason to doubt thatnatural selection might be most effective in giving the proper colourto each kind of grouse and in keeping that colour when once acquired true and constant nor ought we to think that the occasional destructionof an animal of any particular colour would produce little effect weshould remember how essential it is in a flock of white sheep to destroyevery lamb with the faintest trace of black in plants the down onthe fruit and the colour of the flesh are considered by botanistsas characters of the most trifling importance yet we hear froman excellent horticulturist downing that in the united statessmooth skinned fruits suffer far more from a beetle a curculio thanthose with down that purple plums suffer far more from a certaindisease than yellow plums whereas another disease attacksyellow fleshed peaches far more than those with other coloured flesh if with all the aids of art these slight differences make a greatdifference in cultivating the several varieties assuredly in a stateof nature where the trees would have to struggle with other trees andwith a host of enemies such differences would effectually settle whichvariety whether a smooth or downy a yellow or purple fleshed fruit should succeed in looking at many small points of difference between species which asfar as our ignorance permits us to judge seem to be quite unimportant we must not forget that climate food etc probably produce someslight and direct effect it is however far more necessary to bear inmind that there are many unknown laws of correlation of growth which when one part of the organisation is modified through variation and themodifications are accumulated by natural selection for the good of thebeing will cause other modifications often of the most unexpectednature as we see that those variations which under domestication appear at anyparticular period of life tend to reappear in the offspring at thesame period for instance in the seeds of the many varieties of ourculinary and agricultural plants in the caterpillar and cocoon stagesof the varieties of the silkworm in the eggs of poultry and in thecolour of the down of their chickens in the horns of our sheep andcattle when nearly adult so in a state of nature natural selectionwill be enabled to act on and modify organic beings at any age bythe accumulation of profitable variations at that age and by theirinheritance at a corresponding age if it profit a plant to have itsseeds more and more widely disseminated by the wind i can see nogreater difficulty in this being effected through natural selection than in the cotton planter increasing and improving by selection thedown in the pods on his cotton trees natural selection may modifyand adapt the larva of an insect to a score of contingencies wholly different from those which concern the mature insect thesemodifications will no doubt affect through the laws of correlation thestructure of the adult and probably in the case of those insects whichlive only for a few hours and which never feed a large part of theirstructure is merely the correlated result of successive changes in thestructure of their larvae so conversely modifications in the adultwill probably often affect the structure of the larva but in all casesnatural selection will ensure that modifications consequent on othermodifications at a different period of life shall not be in the leastdegree injurious for if they became so they would cause the extinctionof the species natural selection will modify the structure of the young in relationto the parent and of the parent in relation to the young in socialanimals it will adapt the structure of each individual for the benefitof the community if each in consequence profits by the selected change what natural selection cannot do is to modify the structure of onespecies without giving it any advantage for the good of anotherspecies and though statements to this effect may be found in works ofnatural history i cannot find one case which will bear investigation a structure used only once in an animal s whole life if of highimportance to it might be modified to any extent by natural selection for instance the great jaws possessed by certain insects and usedexclusively for opening the cocoon or the hard tip to the beak ofnestling birds used for breaking the egg it has been asserted thatof the best short beaked tumbler pigeons more perish in the egg than areable to get out of it so that fanciers assist in the act of hatching now if nature had to make the beak of a full grown pigeon very shortfor the bird s own advantage the process of modification would be veryslow and there would be simultaneously the most rigorous selection ofthe young birds within the egg which had the most powerful and hardestbeaks for all with weak beaks would inevitably perish or moredelicate and more easily broken shells might be selected the thicknessof the shell being known to vary like every other structure sexual selection inasmuch as peculiarities often appear under domestication in one sexand become hereditarily attached to that sex the same fact probablyoccurs under nature and if so natural selection will be able to modifyone sex in its functional relations to the other sex or in relation towholly different habits of life in the two sexes as is sometimes thecase with insects and this leads me to say a few words on what i callsexual selection this depends not on a struggle for existence but ona struggle between the males for possession of the females the resultis not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring sexual selection is therefore less rigorous than natural selection generally the most vigorous males those which are best fitted fortheir places in nature will leave most progeny but in many cases victory will depend not on general vigour but on having specialweapons confined to the male sex a hornless stag or spurless cockwould have a poor chance of leaving offspring sexual selection byalways allowing the victor to breed might surely give indomitablecourage length to the spur and strength to the wing to strike in thespurred leg as well as the brutal cock fighter who knows well that hecan improve his breed by careful selection of the best cocks how lowin the scale of nature this law of battle descends i know not malealligators have been described as fighting bellowing and whirlinground like indians in a war dance for the possession of the females male salmons have been seen fighting all day long male stag beetlesoften bear wounds from the huge mandibles of other males the war is perhaps severest between the males of polygamous animals and theseseem oftenest provided with special weapons the males of carnivorousanimals are already well armed though to them and to others specialmeans of defence may be given through means of sexual selection as themane to the lion the shoulder pad to the boar and the hooked jaw tothe male salmon for the shield may be as important for victory as thesword or spear amongst birds the contest is often of a more peaceful character all those who have attended to the subject believe that there is theseverest rivalry between the males of many species to attract by singingthe females the rock thrush of guiana birds of paradise and someothers congregate and successive males display their gorgeous plumageand perform strange antics before the females which standing by asspectators at last choose the most attractive partner those who haveclosely attended to birds in confinement well know that they often takeindividual preferences and dislikes thus sir r heron has described howone pied peacock was eminently attractive to all his hen birds it mayappear childish to attribute any effect to such apparently weak means icannot here enter on the details necessary to support this view but ifman can in a short time give elegant carriage and beauty to his bantams according to his standard of beauty i can see no good reason to doubtthat female birds by selecting during thousands of generations the most melodious or beautiful males according to their standard ofbeauty might produce a marked effect i strongly suspect that somewell known laws with respect to the plumage of male and female birds incomparison with the plumage of the young can be explained on the viewof plumage having been chiefly modified by sexual selection acting whenthe birds have come to the breeding age or during the breeding season the modifications thus produced being inherited at corresponding ages orseasons either by the males alone or by the males and females but ihave not space here to enter on this subject thus it is as i believe that when the males and females of any animalhave the same general habits of life but differ in structure colour or ornament such differences have been mainly caused by sexualselection that is individual males have had in successivegenerations some slight advantage over other males in their weapons means of defence or charms and have transmitted these advantages totheir male offspring yet i would not wish to attribute all suchsexual differences to this agency for we see peculiarities arising andbecoming attached to the male sex in our domestic animals as the wattlein male carriers horn like protuberances in the cocks of certain fowls etc which we cannot believe to be either useful to the males inbattle or attractive to the females we see analogous cases undernature for instance the tuft of hair on the breast of the turkey cock which can hardly be either useful or ornamental to this bird indeed had the tuft appeared under domestication it would have been called amonstrosity illustrations of the action of natural selection in order to make it clear how as i believe natural selection acts imust beg permission to give one or two imaginary illustrations let ustake the case of a wolf which preys on various animals securing someby craft some by strength and some by fleetness and let us supposethat the fleetest prey a deer for instance had from any change inthe country increased in numbers or that other prey had decreased innumbers during that season of the year when the wolf is hardest pressedfor food i can under such circumstances see no reason to doubt that theswiftest and slimmest wolves would have the best chance of surviving and so be preserved or selected provided always that they retainedstrength to master their prey at this or at some other period of theyear when they might be compelled to prey on other animals i can seeno more reason to doubt this than that man can improve the fleetnessof his greyhounds by careful and methodical selection or by thatunconscious selection which results from each man trying to keep thebest dogs without any thought of modifying the breed even without any change in the proportional numbers of the animals onwhich our wolf preyed a cub might be born with an innate tendency topursue certain kinds of prey nor can this be thought very improbable for we often observe great differences in the natural tendencies of ourdomestic animals one cat for instance taking to catch rats anothermice one cat according to mr st john bringing home winged game another hares or rabbits and another hunting on marshy ground andalmost nightly catching woodcocks or snipes the tendency to catch ratsrather than mice is known to be inherited now if any slight innatechange of habit or of structure benefited an individual wolf it wouldhave the best chance of surviving and of leaving offspring some of itsyoung would probably inherit the same habits or structure and by therepetition of this process a new variety might be formed which wouldeither supplant or coexist with the parent form of wolf or again the wolves inhabiting a mountainous district and those frequenting thelowlands would naturally be forced to hunt different prey and from thecontinued preservation of the individuals best fitted for the two sites two varieties might slowly be formed these varieties would cross andblend where they met but to this subject of intercrossing we shall soonhave to return i may add that according to mr pierce there are twovarieties of the wolf inhabiting the catskill mountains in the unitedstates one with a light greyhound like form which pursues deer andthe other more bulky with shorter legs which more frequently attacksthe shepherd s flocks let us now take a more complex case certain plants excrete a sweetjuice apparently for the sake of eliminating something injurious fromtheir sap this is effected by glands at the base of the stipules insome leguminosae and at the back of the leaf of the common laurel thisjuice though small in quantity is greedily sought by insects let usnow suppose a little sweet juice or nectar to be excreted by the innerbases of the petals of a flower in this case insects in seeking thenectar would get dusted with pollen and would certainly often transportthe pollen from one flower to the stigma of another flower the flowersof two distinct individuals of the same species would thus get crossed and the act of crossing we have good reason to believe as willhereafter be more fully alluded to would produce very vigorousseedlings which consequently would have the best chance of flourishingand surviving some of these seedlings would probably inherit thenectar excreting power those individual flowers which had the largestglands or nectaries and which excreted most nectar would be oftenestvisited by insects and would be oftenest crossed and so in thelong run would gain the upper hand those flowers also which had theirstamens and pistils placed in relation to the size and habits of theparticular insects which visited them so as to favour in any degreethe transportal of their pollen from flower to flower would likewise befavoured or selected we might have taken the case of insects visitingflowers for the sake of collecting pollen instead of nectar and aspollen is formed for the sole object of fertilisation its destructionappears a simple loss to the plant yet if a little pollen were carried at first occasionally and then habitually by the pollen devouringinsects from flower to flower and a cross thus effected althoughnine tenths of the pollen were destroyed it might still be a great gainto the plant and those individuals which produced more and more pollen and had larger and larger anthers would be selected when our plant by this process of the continued preservation or naturalselection of more and more attractive flowers had been rendered highlyattractive to insects they would unintentionally on their part regularly carry pollen from flower to flower and that they can mosteffectually do this i could easily show by many striking instances i will give only one not as a very striking case but as likewiseillustrating one step in the separation of the sexes of plants presently to be alluded to some holly trees bear only male flowers which have four stamens producing rather a small quantity of pollen anda rudimentary pistil other holly trees bear only female flowers thesehave a full sized pistil and four stamens with shrivelled anthers inwhich not a grain of pollen can be detected having found a femaletree exactly sixty yards from a male tree i put the stigmas of twentyflowers taken from different branches under the microscope andon all without exception there were pollen grains and on some aprofusion of pollen as the wind had set for several days from thefemale to the male tree the pollen could not thus have been carried the weather had been cold and boisterous and therefore not favourableto bees nevertheless every female flower which i examined had beeneffectually fertilised by the bees accidentally dusted with pollen having flown from tree to tree in search of nectar but to return toour imaginary case as soon as the plant had been rendered so highlyattractive to insects that pollen was regularly carried from flowerto flower another process might commence no naturalist doubts theadvantage of what has been called the physiological division oflabour hence we may believe that it would be advantageous to a plantto produce stamens alone in one flower or on one whole plant andpistils alone in another flower or on another plant in plants underculture and placed under new conditions of life sometimes the maleorgans and sometimes the female organs become more or less impotent now if we suppose this to occur in ever so slight a degree under nature then as pollen is already carried regularly from flower to flower and as a more complete separation of the sexes of our plant would beadvantageous on the principle of the division of labour individualswith this tendency more and more increased would be continuallyfavoured or selected until at last a complete separation of the sexeswould be effected let us now turn to the nectar feeding insects in our imaginary case wemay suppose the plant of which we have been slowly increasing the nectarby continued selection to be a common plant and that certain insectsdepended in main part on its nectar for food i could give many facts showing how anxious bees are to save time for instance their habit ofcutting holes and sucking the nectar at the bases of certain flowers which they can with a very little more trouble enter by the mouth bearing such facts in mind i can see no reason to doubt that anaccidental deviation in the size and form of the body or in thecurvature and length of the proboscis etc far too slight to beappreciated by us might profit a bee or other insect so that anindividual so characterised would be able to obtain its food morequickly and so have a better chance of living and leaving descendants its descendants would probably inherit a tendency to a similar slightdeviation of structure the tubes of the corollas of the common red andincarnate clovers trifolium pratense and incarnatum do not on a hastyglance appear to differ in length yet the hive bee can easily suckthe nectar out of the incarnate clover but not out of the common redclover which is visited by humble bees alone so that whole fields ofthe red clover offer in vain an abundant supply of precious nectar tothe hive bee thus it might be a great advantage to the hive bee to havea slightly longer or differently constructed proboscis on the otherhand i have found by experiment that the fertility of clover greatlydepends on bees visiting and moving parts of the corolla so as to pushthe pollen on to the stigmatic surface hence again if humble beeswere to become rare in any country it might be a great advantage to thered clover to have a shorter or more deeply divided tube to its corolla so that the hive bee could visit its flowers thus i can understand howa flower and a bee might slowly become either simultaneously or oneafter the other modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to eachother by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutualand slightly favourable deviations of structure i am well aware that this doctrine of natural selection exemplified inthe above imaginary instances is open to the same objections which wereat first urged against sir charles lyell s noble views on the modernchanges of the earth as illustrative of geology but we now veryseldom hear the action for instance of the coast waves called atrifling and insignificant cause when applied to the excavation ofgigantic valleys or to the formation of the longest lines of inlandcliffs natural selection can act only by the preservation andaccumulation of infinitesimally small inherited modifications eachprofitable to the preserved being and as modern geology has almostbanished such views as the excavation of a great valley by a singlediluvial wave so will natural selection if it be a true principle banish the belief of the continued creation of new organic beings or ofany great and sudden modification in their structure on the intercrossing of individuals i must here introduce a short digression in the case of animalsand plants with separated sexes it is of course obvious that twoindividuals must always unite for each birth but in the case ofhermaphrodites this is far from obvious nevertheless i am stronglyinclined to believe that with all hermaphrodites two individuals eitheroccasionally or habitually concur for the reproduction of their kind this view i may add was first suggested by andrew knight we shallpresently see its importance but i must here treat the subject withextreme brevity though i have the materials prepared for an amplediscussion all vertebrate animals all insects and some other largegroups of animals pair for each birth modern research has muchdiminished the number of supposed hermaphrodites and of realhermaphrodites a large number pair that is two individuals regularlyunite for reproduction which is all that concerns us but still thereare many hermaphrodite animals which certainly do not habitually pair and a vast majority of plants are hermaphrodites what reason it may beasked is there for supposing in these cases that two individuals everconcur in reproduction as it is impossible here to enter on details imust trust to some general considerations alone in the first place i have collected so large a body of facts showing in accordance with the almost universal belief of breeders that withanimals and plants a cross between different varieties or betweenindividuals of the same variety but of another strain gives vigourand fertility to the offspring and on the other hand that closeinterbreeding diminishes vigour and fertility that these facts aloneincline me to believe that it is a general law of nature utterlyignorant though we be of the meaning of the law that no organic beingself fertilises itself for an eternity of generations but that across with another individual is occasionally perhaps at very longintervals indispensable on the belief that this is a law of nature we can i think understandseveral large classes of facts such as the following which on anyother view are inexplicable every hybridizer knows how unfavourableexposure to wet is to the fertilisation of a flower yet what amultitude of flowers have their anthers and stigmas fully exposed tothe weather but if an occasional cross be indispensable the fullestfreedom for the entrance of pollen from another individual will explainthis state of exposure more especially as the plant s own anthers andpistil generally stand so close together that self fertilisation seemsalmost inevitable many flowers on the other hand have their organsof fructification closely enclosed as in the great papilionaceous orpea family but in several perhaps in all such flowers there is avery curious adaptation between the structure of the flower and themanner in which bees suck the nectar for in doing this they eitherpush the flower s own pollen on the stigma or bring pollen from anotherflower so necessary are the visits of bees to papilionaceous flowers that i have found by experiments published elsewhere that theirfertility is greatly diminished if these visits be prevented now itis scarcely possible that bees should fly from flower to flower and notcarry pollen from one to the other to the great good as i believe of the plant bees will act like a camel hair pencil and it is quitesufficient just to touch the anthers of one flower and then the stigmaof another with the same brush to ensure fertilisation but it must notbe supposed that bees would thus produce a multitude of hybrids betweendistinct species for if you bring on the same brush a plant s ownpollen and pollen from another species the former will have such aprepotent effect that it will invariably and completely destroy as hasbeen shown by gartner any influence from the foreign pollen when the stamens of a flower suddenly spring towards the pistil orslowly move one after the other towards it the contrivance seemsadapted solely to ensure self fertilisation and no doubt it is usefulfor this end but the agency of insects is often required to cause thestamens to spring forward as kolreuter has shown to be the case withthe barberry and curiously in this very genus which seems to have aspecial contrivance for self fertilisation it is well known that ifvery closely allied forms or varieties are planted near each other itis hardly possible to raise pure seedlings so largely do theynaturally cross in many other cases far from there being any aids forself fertilisation there are special contrivances as i could showfrom the writings of c c sprengel and from my own observations whicheffectually prevent the stigma receiving pollen from its own flower forinstance in lobelia fulgens there is a really beautiful andelaborate contrivance by which every one of the infinitely numerouspollen granules are swept out of the conjoined anthers of each flower before the stigma of that individual flower is ready to receive them and as this flower is never visited at least in my garden by insects it never sets a seed though by placing pollen from one flower on thestigma of another i raised plenty of seedlings and whilst anotherspecies of lobelia growing close by which is visited by bees seedsfreely in very many other cases though there be no special mechanicalcontrivance to prevent the stigma of a flower receiving its own pollen yet as c c sprengel has shown and as i can confirm either theanthers burst before the stigma is ready for fertilisation or thestigma is ready before the pollen of that flower is ready so that theseplants have in fact separated sexes and must habitually be crossed how strange are these facts how strange that the pollen and stigmaticsurface of the same flower though placed so close together as iffor the very purpose of self fertilisation should in so many cases bemutually useless to each other how simply are these facts explainedon the view of an occasional cross with a distinct individual beingadvantageous or indispensable if several varieties of the cabbage radish onion and of some otherplants be allowed to seed near each other a large majority as ihave found of the seedlings thus raised will turn out mongrels forinstance i raised seedling cabbages from some plants of differentvarieties growing near each other and of these only were true totheir kind and some even of these were not perfectly true yet thepistil of each cabbage flower is surrounded not only by its own sixstamens but by those of the many other flowers on the same plant how then comes it that such a vast number of the seedlings are mongrelized i suspect that it must arise from the pollen of a distinct varietyhaving a prepotent effect over a flower s own pollen and that this ispart of the general law of good being derived from the intercrossingof distinct individuals of the same species when distinct species arecrossed the case is directly the reverse for a plant s own pollenis always prepotent over foreign pollen but to this subject we shallreturn in a future chapter in the case of a gigantic tree covered with innumerable flowers it maybe objected that pollen could seldom be carried from tree to tree andat most only from flower to flower on the same tree and that flowerson the same tree can be considered as distinct individuals only in alimited sense i believe this objection to be valid but that nature haslargely provided against it by giving to trees a strong tendency to bearflowers with separated sexes when the sexes are separated althoughthe male and female flowers may be produced on the same tree we can seethat pollen must be regularly carried from flower to flower and thiswill give a better chance of pollen being occasionally carried from treeto tree that trees belonging to all orders have their sexes more oftenseparated than other plants i find to be the case in this country andat my request dr hooker tabulated the trees of new zealand and dr asagray those of the united states and the result was as i anticipated onthe other hand dr hooker has recently informed me that he finds thatthe rule does not hold in australia and i have made these few remarkson the sexes of trees simply to call attention to the subject turning for a very brief space to animals on the land there are somehermaphrodites as land mollusca and earth worms but these all pair as yet i have not found a single case of a terrestrial animal whichfertilises itself we can understand this remarkable fact whichoffers so strong a contrast with terrestrial plants on the view of anoccasional cross being indispensable by considering the medium in whichterrestrial animals live and the nature of the fertilising element forwe know of no means analogous to the action of insects and of the windin the case of plants by which an occasional cross could be effectedwith terrestrial animals without the concurrence of two individuals of aquatic animals there are many self fertilising hermaphrodites but here currents in the water offer an obvious means for an occasionalcross and as in the case of flowers i have as yet failed afterconsultation with one of the highest authorities namely professorhuxley to discover a single case of an hermaphrodite animal with theorgans of reproduction so perfectly enclosed within the body thataccess from without and the occasional influence of a distinctindividual can be shown to be physically impossible cirripedes longappeared to me to present a case of very great difficulty under thispoint of view but i have been enabled by a fortunate chance elsewhereto prove that two individuals though both are self fertilisinghermaphrodites do sometimes cross it must have struck most naturalists as a strange anomaly that in thecase of both animals and plants species of the same family and even ofthe same genus though agreeing closely with each other in almost theirwhole organisation yet are not rarely some of them hermaphrodites and some of them unisexual but if in fact all hermaphrodites dooccasionally intercross with other individuals the difference betweenhermaphrodites and unisexual species as far as function is concerned becomes very small from these several considerations and from the many special facts whichi have collected but which i am not here able to give i am stronglyinclined to suspect that both in the vegetable and animal kingdoms anoccasional intercross with a distinct individual is a law of nature iam well aware that there are on this view many cases of difficulty some of which i am trying to investigate finally then we may concludethat in many organic beings a cross between two individuals is anobvious necessity for each birth in many others it occurs perhaps onlyat long intervals but in none as i suspect can self fertilisation goon for perpetuity circumstances favourable to natural selection this is an extremely intricate subject a large amount of inheritableand diversified variability is favourable but i believe mere individualdifferences suffice for the work a large number of individuals bygiving a better chance for the appearance within any given periodof profitable variations will compensate for a lesser amount ofvariability in each individual and is i believe an extremelyimportant element of success though nature grants vast periods of timefor the work of natural selection she does not grant an indefiniteperiod for as all organic beings are striving it may be said to seizeon each place in the economy of nature if any one species doesnot become modified and improved in a corresponding degree with itscompetitors it will soon be exterminated in man s methodical selection a breeder selects for some definiteobject and free intercrossing will wholly stop his work but when manymen without intending to alter the breed have a nearly common standardof perfection and all try to get and breed from the best animals much improvement and modification surely but slowly follow from thisunconscious process of selection notwithstanding a large amount ofcrossing with inferior animals thus it will be in nature for within aconfined area with some place in its polity not so perfectly occupiedas might be natural selection will always tend to preserve all theindividuals varying in the right direction though in different degrees so as better to fill up the unoccupied place but if the area be large its several districts will almost certainly present different conditionsof life and then if natural selection be modifying and improving aspecies in the several districts there will be intercrossing with theother individuals of the same species on the confines of each and inthis case the effects of intercrossing can hardly be counterbalanced bynatural selection always tending to modify all the individuals in eachdistrict in exactly the same manner to the conditions of each for in acontinuous area the conditions will generally graduate away insensiblyfrom one district to another the intercrossing will most affect thoseanimals which unite for each birth which wander much and which donot breed at a very quick rate hence in animals of this nature forinstance in birds varieties will generally be confined to separatedcountries and this i believe to be the case in hermaphrodite organismswhich cross only occasionally and likewise in animals which unite foreach birth but which wander little and which can increase at a veryrapid rate a new and improved variety might be quickly formed on anyone spot and might there maintain itself in a body so that whateverintercrossing took place would be chiefly between the individuals ofthe same new variety a local variety when once thus formed mightsubsequently slowly spread to other districts on the above principle nurserymen always prefer getting seed from a large body of plants ofthe same variety as the chance of intercrossing with other varieties isthus lessened even in the case of slow breeding animals which unite for each birth we must not overrate the effects of intercrosses in retarding naturalselection for i can bring a considerable catalogue of facts showingthat within the same area varieties of the same animal can long remaindistinct from haunting different stations from breeding at slightlydifferent seasons or from varieties of the same kind preferring to pairtogether intercrossing plays a very important part in nature in keeping theindividuals of the same species or of the same variety true anduniform in character it will obviously thus act far more efficientlywith those animals which unite for each birth but i have alreadyattempted to show that we have reason to believe that occasionalintercrosses take place with all animals and with all plants even ifthese take place only at long intervals i am convinced that theyoung thus produced will gain so much in vigour and fertility over theoffspring from long continued self fertilisation that they will have abetter chance of surviving and propagating their kind and thus in thelong run the influence of intercrosses even at rare intervals will begreat if there exist organic beings which never intercross uniformityof character can be retained amongst them as long as their conditionsof life remain the same only through the principle of inheritance andthrough natural selection destroying any which depart from theproper type but if their conditions of life change and they undergomodification uniformity of character can be given to their modifiedoffspring solely by natural selection preserving the same favourablevariations isolation also is an important element in the process of naturalselection in a confined or isolated area if not very large theorganic and inorganic conditions of life will generally be in a greatdegree uniform so that natural selection will tend to modify all theindividuals of a varying species throughout the area in the samemanner in relation to the same conditions intercrosses also with theindividuals of the same species which otherwise would have inhabitedthe surrounding and differently circumstanced districts will beprevented but isolation probably acts more efficiently in checking theimmigration of better adapted organisms after any physical change suchas of climate or elevation of the land etc and thus new places in thenatural economy of the country are left open for the old inhabitantsto struggle for and become adapted to through modifications in theirstructure and constitution lastly isolation by checking immigrationand consequently competition will give time for any new variety tobe slowly improved and this may sometimes be of importance in theproduction of new species if however an isolated area be very small either from being surrounded by barriers or from having very peculiarphysical conditions the total number of the individuals supported on itwill necessarily be very small and fewness of individuals will greatlyretard the production of new species through natural selection bydecreasing the chance of the appearance of favourable variations if we turn to nature to test the truth of these remarks and look atany small isolated area such as an oceanic island although the totalnumber of the species inhabiting it will be found to be small as weshall see in our chapter on geographical distribution yet of thesespecies a very large proportion are endemic that is have beenproduced there and nowhere else hence an oceanic island at first sightseems to have been highly favourable for the production of new species but we may thus greatly deceive ourselves for to ascertain whether asmall isolated area or a large open area like a continent has beenmost favourable for the production of new organic forms we ought tomake the comparison within equal times and this we are incapable ofdoing although i do not doubt that isolation is of considerable importancein the production of new species on the whole i am inclined to believethat largeness of area is of more importance more especially in theproduction of species which will prove capable of enduring for a longperiod and of spreading widely throughout a great and open area notonly will there be a better chance of favourable variations arising fromthe large number of individuals of the same species there supported butthe conditions of life are infinitely complex from the large numberof already existing species and if some of these many speciesbecome modified and improved others will have to be improved in acorresponding degree or they will be exterminated each new form also as soon as it has been much improved will be able to spread over theopen and continuous area and will thus come into competition with manyothers hence more new places will be formed and the competition tofill them will be more severe on a large than on a small andisolated area moreover great areas though now continuous owing tooscillations of level will often have recently existed in a brokencondition so that the good effects of isolation will generally to acertain extent have concurred finally i conclude that although smallisolated areas probably have been in some respects highly favourable forthe production of new species yet that the course of modificationwill generally have been more rapid on large areas and what is moreimportant that the new forms produced on large areas which alreadyhave been victorious over many competitors will be those that willspread most widely will give rise to most new varieties and species and will thus play an important part in the changing history of theorganic world we can perhaps on these views understand some facts which willbe again alluded to in our chapter on geographical distribution forinstance that the productions of the smaller continent of australiahave formerly yielded and apparently are now yielding before thoseof the larger europaeo asiatic area thus also it is that continentalproductions have everywhere become so largely naturalised on islands ona small island the race for life will have been less severe and therewill have been less modification and less extermination hence perhaps it comes that the flora of madeira according to oswald heer resemblesthe extinct tertiary flora of europe all fresh water basins takentogether make a small area compared with that of the sea or of theland and consequently the competition between fresh water productionswill have been less severe than elsewhere new forms will have beenmore slowly formed and old forms more slowly exterminated and it isin fresh water that we find seven genera of ganoid fishes remnants ofa once preponderant order and in fresh water we find some of the mostanomalous forms now known in the world as the ornithorhynchus andlepidosiren which like fossils connect to a certain extent orders nowwidely separated in the natural scale these anomalous forms may almostbe called living fossils they have endured to the present day fromhaving inhabited a confined area and from having thus been exposed toless severe competition to sum up the circumstances favourable and unfavourable to naturalselection as far as the extreme intricacy of the subject permits iconclude looking to the future that for terrestrial productions alarge continental area which will probably undergo many oscillationsof level and which consequently will exist for long periods in a brokencondition will be the most favourable for the production of many newforms of life likely to endure long and to spread widely for the areawill first have existed as a continent and the inhabitants at thisperiod numerous in individuals and kinds will have been subjectedto very severe competition when converted by subsidence into largeseparate islands there will still exist many individuals of the samespecies on each island intercrossing on the confines of the range ofeach species will thus be checked after physical changes of any kind immigration will be prevented so that new places in the polity ofeach island will have to be filled up by modifications of the oldinhabitants and time will be allowed for the varieties in each tobecome well modified and perfected when by renewed elevation theislands shall be re converted into a continental area there will againbe severe competition the most favoured or improved varieties will beenabled to spread there will be much extinction of the less improvedforms and the relative proportional numbers of the various inhabitantsof the renewed continent will again be changed and again there willbe a fair field for natural selection to improve still further theinhabitants and thus produce new species that natural selection will always act with extreme slowness i fullyadmit its action depends on there being places in the polity of nature which can be better occupied by some of the inhabitants of the countryundergoing modification of some kind the existence of such places willoften depend on physical changes which are generally very slow andon the immigration of better adapted forms having been checked but theaction of natural selection will probably still oftener depend on someof the inhabitants becoming slowly modified the mutual relations ofmany of the other inhabitants being thus disturbed nothing can beeffected unless favourable variations occur and variation itself isapparently always a very slow process the process will often be greatlyretarded by free intercrossing many will exclaim that these severalcauses are amply sufficient wholly to stop the action of naturalselection i do not believe so on the other hand i do believe thatnatural selection will always act very slowly often only at longintervals of time and generally on only a very few of the inhabitantsof the same region at the same time i further believe that this veryslow intermittent action of natural selection accords perfectlywell with what geology tells us of the rate and manner at which theinhabitants of this world have changed slow though the process of selection may be if feeble man can do muchby his powers of artificial selection i can see no limit to the amountof change to the beauty and infinite complexity of the coadaptationsbetween all organic beings one with another and with their physicalconditions of life which may be effected in the long course of time bynature s power of selection extinction this subject will be more fully discussed in our chapter on geology butit must be here alluded to from being intimately connected with naturalselection natural selection acts solely through the preservation ofvariations in some way advantageous which consequently endure but asfrom the high geometrical powers of increase of all organic beings eacharea is already fully stocked with inhabitants it follows that aseach selected and favoured form increases in number so will the lessfavoured forms decrease and become rare rarity as geology tells us isthe precursor to extinction we can also see that any form representedby few individuals will during fluctuations in the seasons or in thenumber of its enemies run a good chance of utter extinction but we maygo further than this for as new forms are continually and slowly beingproduced unless we believe that the number of specific forms goes onperpetually and almost indefinitely increasing numbers inevitably mustbecome extinct that the number of specific forms has not indefinitelyincreased geology shows us plainly and indeed we can see reason whythey should not have thus increased for the number of places in thepolity of nature is not indefinitely great not that we have any meansof knowing that any one region has as yet got its maximum of species probably no region is as yet fully stocked for at the cape of goodhope where more species of plants are crowded together than in anyother quarter of the world some foreign plants have become naturalised without causing as far as we know the extinction of any natives furthermore the species which are most numerous in individuals willhave the best chance of producing within any given period favourablevariations we have evidence of this in the facts given in the secondchapter showing that it is the common species which afford the greatestnumber of recorded varieties or incipient species hence rare specieswill be less quickly modified or improved within any given period andthey will consequently be beaten in the race for life by the modifieddescendants of the commoner species from these several considerations i think it inevitably follows that asnew species in the course of time are formed through natural selection others will become rarer and rarer and finally extinct the forms whichstand in closest competition with those undergoing modification andimprovement will naturally suffer most and we have seen in thechapter on the struggle for existence that it is the most closely alliedforms varieties of the same species and species of the same genusor of related genera which from having nearly the same structure constitution and habits generally come into the severest competitionwith each other consequently each new variety or species during theprogress of its formation will generally press hardest on its nearestkindred and tend to exterminate them we see the same process ofextermination amongst our domesticated productions through theselection of improved forms by man many curious instances couldbe given showing how quickly new breeds of cattle sheep and otheranimals and varieties of flowers take the place of older and inferiorkinds in yorkshire it is historically known that the ancient blackcattle were displaced by the long horns and that these were swept awayby the short horns i quote the words of an agricultural writer as ifby some murderous pestilence divergence of character the principle which i have designated by this term is of highimportance on my theory and explains as i believe several importantfacts in the first place varieties even strongly marked ones thoughhaving somewhat of the character of species as is shown by the hopelessdoubts in many cases how to rank them yet certainly differ fromeach other far less than do good and distinct species nevertheless according to my view varieties are species in the process of formation or are as i have called them incipient species how then does thelesser difference between varieties become augmented into the greaterdifference between species that this does habitually happen we mustinfer from most of the innumerable species throughout nature presentingwell marked differences whereas varieties the supposed prototypes andparents of future well marked species present slight and ill defineddifferences mere chance as we may call it might cause one varietyto differ in some character from its parents and the offspring of thisvariety again to differ from its parent in the very same character andin a greater degree but this alone would never account for so habitualand large an amount of difference as that between varieties of the samespecies and species of the same genus as has always been my practice let us seek light on this head from ourdomestic productions we shall here find something analogous a fancieris struck by a pigeon having a slightly shorter beak another fancier isstruck by a pigeon having a rather longer beak and on the acknowledgedprinciple that fanciers do not and will not admire a medium standard but like extremes they both go on as has actually occurred withtumbler pigeons choosing and breeding from birds with longer and longerbeaks or with shorter and shorter beaks again we may suppose that atan early period one man preferred swifter horses another stronger andmore bulky horses the early differences would be very slight in thecourse of time from the continued selection of swifter horses by somebreeders and of stronger ones by others the differences would becomegreater and would be noted as forming two sub breeds finally afterthe lapse of centuries the sub breeds would become converted into twowell established and distinct breeds as the differences slowly becomegreater the inferior animals with intermediate characters beingneither very swift nor very strong will have been neglected and willhave tended to disappear here then we see in man s productionsthe action of what may be called the principle of divergence causingdifferences at first barely appreciable steadily to increase andthe breeds to diverge in character both from each other and from theircommon parent but how it may be asked can any analogous principle apply in nature i believe it can and does apply most efficiently from the simplecircumstance that the more diversified the descendants from any onespecies become in structure constitution and habits by so much willthey be better enabled to seize on many and widely diversified places inthe polity of nature and so be enabled to increase in numbers we can clearly see this in the case of animals with simple habits takethe case of a carnivorous quadruped of which the number that can besupported in any country has long ago arrived at its full average ifits natural powers of increase be allowed to act it can succeed inincreasing the country not undergoing any change in its conditions only by its varying descendants seizing on places at present occupied byother animals some of them for instance being enabled to feed onnew kinds of prey either dead or alive some inhabiting new stations climbing trees frequenting water and some perhaps becoming lesscarnivorous the more diversified in habits and structure thedescendants of our carnivorous animal became the more places they wouldbe enabled to occupy what applies to one animal will apply throughoutall time to all animals that is if they vary for otherwise naturalselection can do nothing so it will be with plants it has beenexperimentally proved that if a plot of ground be sown with one speciesof grass and a similar plot be sown with several distinct genera ofgrasses a greater number of plants and a greater weight of dry herbagecan thus be raised the same has been found to hold good when firstone variety and then several mixed varieties of wheat have been sown onequal spaces of ground hence if any one species of grass were to goon varying and those varieties were continually selected which differedfrom each other in at all the same manner as distinct species and generaof grasses differ from each other a greater number of individual plantsof this species of grass including its modified descendants wouldsucceed in living on the same piece of ground and we well know thateach species and each variety of grass is annually sowing almostcountless seeds and thus as it may be said is striving its utmost toincrease its numbers consequently i cannot doubt that in the courseof many thousands of generations the most distinct varieties of any onespecies of grass would always have the best chance of succeeding andof increasing in numbers and thus of supplanting the less distinctvarieties and varieties when rendered very distinct from each other take the rank of species the truth of the principle that the greatest amount of life can besupported by great diversification of structure is seen under manynatural circumstances in an extremely small area especially if freelyopen to immigration and where the contest between individual andindividual must be severe we always find great diversity in itsinhabitants for instance i found that a piece of turf three feet byfour in size which had been exposed for many years to exactly the sameconditions supported twenty species of plants and these belonged toeighteen genera and to eight orders which shows how much these plantsdiffered from each other so it is with the plants and insects on smalland uniform islets and so in small ponds of fresh water farmers findthat they can raise most food by a rotation of plants belonging to themost different orders nature follows what may be called a simultaneousrotation most of the animals and plants which live close round anysmall piece of ground could live on it supposing it not to be inany way peculiar in its nature and may be said to be striving to theutmost to live there but it is seen that where they come into theclosest competition with each other the advantages of diversificationof structure with the accompanying differences of habit andconstitution determine that the inhabitants which thus jostle eachother most closely shall as a general rule belong to what we calldifferent genera and orders the same principle is seen in the naturalisation of plants through man sagency in foreign lands it might have been expected that the plantswhich have succeeded in becoming naturalised in any land would generallyhave been closely allied to the indigenes for these are commonly lookedat as specially created and adapted for their own country it might also perhaps have been expected that naturalised plants would havebelonged to a few groups more especially adapted to certain stations intheir new homes but the case is very different and alph de candollehas well remarked in his great and admirable work that floras gain bynaturalisation proportionally with the number of the native genera andspecies far more in new genera than in new species to give a singleinstance in the last edition of dr asa gray s manual of the flora ofthe northern united states naturalised plants are enumerated andthese belong to genera we thus see that these naturalised plantsare of a highly diversified nature they differ moreover to a largeextent from the indigenes for out of the genera no less than genera are not there indigenous and thus a large proportional additionis made to the genera of these states by considering the nature of the plants or animals which have struggledsuccessfully with the indigenes of any country and have there becomenaturalised we can gain some crude idea in what manner some of thenatives would have had to be modified in order to have gained anadvantage over the other natives and we may i think at least safelyinfer that diversification of structure amounting to new genericdifferences would have been profitable to them the advantage of diversification in the inhabitants of the same regionis in fact the same as that of the physiological division of labour inthe organs of the same individual body a subject so well elucidated bymilne edwards no physiologist doubts that a stomach by being adapted todigest vegetable matter alone or flesh alone draws most nutriment fromthese substances so in the general economy of any land the more widelyand perfectly the animals and plants are diversified for differenthabits of life so will a greater number of individuals be capable ofthere supporting themselves a set of animals with their organisationbut little diversified could hardly compete with a set more perfectlydiversified in structure it may be doubted for instance whetherthe australian marsupials which are divided into groups differing butlittle from each other and feebly representing as mr waterhouse andothers have remarked our carnivorous ruminant and rodent mammals could successfully compete with these well pronounced orders in theaustralian mammals we see the process of diversification in an earlyand incomplete stage of development after the foregoing discussion which ought to have been much amplified we may i think assume thatthe modified descendants of any one species will succeed by so muchthe better as they become more diversified in structure and are thusenabled to encroach on places occupied by other beings now let us seehow this principle of great benefit being derived from divergence ofcharacter combined with the principles of natural selection and ofextinction will tend to act the accompanying diagram will aid us in understanding this ratherperplexing subject let a to l represent the species of a genus largein its own country these species are supposed to resemble each otherin unequal degrees as is so generally the case in nature and as isrepresented in the diagram by the letters standing at unequal distances i have said a large genus because we have seen in the second chapter that on an average more of the species of large genera vary than ofsmall genera and the varying species of the large genera present agreater number of varieties we have also seen that the species whichare the commonest and the most widely diffused vary more than rarespecies with restricted ranges let a be a common widely diffused and varying species belonging to a genus large in its own country thelittle fan of diverging dotted lines of unequal lengths proceeding from a may represent its varying offspring the variations are supposedto be extremely slight but of the most diversified nature they are notsupposed all to appear simultaneously but often after long intervals oftime nor are they all supposed to endure for equal periods onlythose variations which are in some way profitable will be preserved ornaturally selected and here the importance of the principle of benefitbeing derived from divergence of character comes in for thiswill generally lead to the most different or divergent variations represented by the outer dotted lines being preserved and accumulatedby natural selection when a dotted line reaches one of the horizontallines and is there marked by a small numbered letter a sufficientamount of variation is supposed to have been accumulated to have formeda fairly well marked variety such as would be thought worthy of recordin a systematic work the intervals between the horizontal lines in the diagram may representeach a thousand generations but it would have been better if each hadrepresented ten thousand generations after a thousand generations species a is supposed to have produced two fairly well markedvarieties namely a and m these two varieties will generally continueto be exposed to the same conditions which made their parents variable and the tendency to variability is in itself hereditary consequentlythey will tend to vary and generally to vary in nearly the same manneras their parents varied moreover these two varieties being onlyslightly modified forms will tend to inherit those advantages whichmade their common parent a more numerous than most of the otherinhabitants of the same country they will likewise partake of thosemore general advantages which made the genus to which the parent speciesbelonged a large genus in its own country and these circumstances weknow to be favourable to the production of new varieties if then these two varieties be variable the most divergent oftheir variations will generally be preserved during the next thousandgenerations and after this interval variety a is supposed in thediagram to have produced variety a which will owing to the principleof divergence differ more from a than did variety a variety m issupposed to have produced two varieties namely m and s differingfrom each other and more considerably from their common parent a wemay continue the process by similar steps for any length of time someof the varieties after each thousand generations producing onlya single variety but in a more and more modified condition someproducing two or three varieties and some failing to produce any thusthe varieties or modified descendants proceeding from the commonparent a will generally go on increasing in number and divergingin character in the diagram the process is represented up to theten thousandth generation and under a condensed and simplified form upto the fourteen thousandth generation but i must here remark that i do not suppose that the process ever goeson so regularly as is represented in the diagram though in itselfmade somewhat irregular i am far from thinking that the most divergentvarieties will invariably prevail and multiply a medium form mayoften long endure and may or may not produce more than one modifieddescendant for natural selection will always act according to thenature of the places which are either unoccupied or not perfectlyoccupied by other beings and this will depend on infinitely complexrelations but as a general rule the more diversified in structure thedescendants from any one species can be rendered the more places theywill be enabled to seize on and the more their modified progeny willbe increased in our diagram the line of succession is broken at regularintervals by small numbered letters marking the successive forms whichhave become sufficiently distinct to be recorded as varieties butthese breaks are imaginary and might have been inserted anywhere afterintervals long enough to have allowed the accumulation of a considerableamount of divergent variation as all the modified descendants from a common and widely diffusedspecies belonging to a large genus will tend to partake of thesame advantages which made their parent successful in life they willgenerally go on multiplying in number as well as diverging in character this is represented in the diagram by the several divergent branchesproceeding from a the modified offspring from the later and morehighly improved branches in the lines of descent will it is probable often take the place of and so destroy the earlier and less improvedbranches this is represented in the diagram by some of the lowerbranches not reaching to the upper horizontal lines in some cases i donot doubt that the process of modification will be confined to asingle line of descent and the number of the descendants will not beincreased although the amount of divergent modification may have beenincreased in the successive generations this case would be representedin the diagram if all the lines proceeding from a were removed excepting that from a to a in the same way for instance theenglish race horse and english pointer have apparently both gone onslowly diverging in character from their original stocks without eitherhaving given off any fresh branches or races after ten thousand generations species a is supposed to have producedthree forms a f and m which from having diverged in characterduring the successive generations will have come to differ largely butperhaps unequally from each other and from their common parent if wesuppose the amount of change between each horizontal line in our diagramto be excessively small these three forms may still be only well markedvarieties or they may have arrived at the doubtful category ofsub species but we have only to suppose the steps in the process ofmodification to be more numerous or greater in amount to convert thesethree forms into well defined species thus the diagram illustratesthe steps by which the small differences distinguishing varietiesare increased into the larger differences distinguishing species bycontinuing the same process for a greater number of generations asshown in the diagram in a condensed and simplified manner we get eightspecies marked by the letters between a and m all descended from a thus as i believe species are multiplied and genera are formed in a large genus it is probable that more than one species would vary in the diagram i have assumed that a second species i has produced byanalogous steps after ten thousand generations either two well markedvarieties w and z or two species according to the amount ofchange supposed to be represented between the horizontal lines afterfourteen thousand generations six new species marked by the lettersn to z are supposed to have been produced in each genus thespecies which are already extremely different in character willgenerally tend to produce the greatest number of modified descendants for these will have the best chance of filling new and widely differentplaces in the polity of nature hence in the diagram i have chosen theextreme species a and the nearly extreme species i as those whichhave largely varied and have given rise to new varieties and species the other nine species marked by capital letters of our originalgenus may for a long period continue transmitting unaltereddescendants and this is shown in the diagram by the dotted lines notprolonged far upwards from want of space but during the process of modification represented in the diagram another of our principles namely that of extinction will have playedan important part as in each fully stocked country natural selectionnecessarily acts by the selected form having some advantage in thestruggle for life over other forms there will be a constant tendency inthe improved descendants of any one species to supplant and exterminatein each stage of descent their predecessors and their original parent for it should be remembered that the competition will generally be mostsevere between those forms which are most nearly related to each otherin habits constitution and structure hence all the intermediate formsbetween the earlier and later states that is between the less and moreimproved state of a species as well as the original parent speciesitself will generally tend to become extinct so it probably will bewith many whole collateral lines of descent which will be conquered bylater and improved lines of descent if however the modified offspringof a species get into some distinct country or become quickly adaptedto some quite new station in which child and parent do not come intocompetition both may continue to exist if then our diagram be assumed to represent a considerable amount ofmodification species a and all the earlier varieties will have becomeextinct having been replaced by eight new species a to m and i will have been replaced by six n to z new species but we may go further than this the original species of our genus weresupposed to resemble each other in unequal degrees as is so generallythe case in nature species a being more nearly related to b c andd than to the other species and species i more to g h k l thanto the others these two species a and i were also supposed to bevery common and widely diffused species so that they must originallyhave had some advantage over most of the other species of thegenus their modified descendants fourteen in number at thefourteen thousandth generation will probably have inherited some ofthe same advantages they have also been modified and improved ina diversified manner at each stage of descent so as to have becomeadapted to many related places in the natural economy of their country it seems therefore to me extremely probable that they will have takenthe places of and thus exterminated not only their parents a and i but likewise some of the original species which were most nearlyrelated to their parents hence very few of the original species willhave transmitted offspring to the fourteen thousandth generation we maysuppose that only one f of the two species which were least closelyrelated to the other nine original species has transmitted descendantsto this late stage of descent the new species in our diagram descended from the original elevenspecies will now be fifteen in number owing to the divergent tendencyof natural selection the extreme amount of difference in characterbetween species a and z will be much greater than that betweenthe most different of the original eleven species the new species moreover will be allied to each other in a widely different manner ofthe eight descendants from a the three marked a q p will benearly related from having recently branched off from a b andf from having diverged at an earlier period from a will be in somedegree distinct from the three first named species and lastly o e and m will be nearly related one to the other but from havingdiverged at the first commencement of the process of modification willbe widely different from the other five species and may constitute asub genus or even a distinct genus the six descendants from i will form two sub genera or even genera but as the original species i differed largely from a standingnearly at the extreme points of the original genus the six descendantsfrom i will owing to inheritance differ considerably from the eightdescendants from a the two groups moreover are supposed to havegone on diverging in different directions the intermediate species also and this is a very important consideration which connected theoriginal species a and i have all become excepting f extinct and have left no descendants hence the six new species descended from i and the eight descended from a will have to be ranked as verydistinct genera or even as distinct sub families thus it is as i believe that two or more genera are produced bydescent with modification from two or more species of the same genus and the two or more parent species are supposed to have descended fromsome one species of an earlier genus in our diagram this is indicatedby the broken lines beneath the capital letters converging insub branches downwards towards a single point this point representing asingle species the supposed single parent of our several new sub generaand genera it is worth while to reflect for a moment on the character of the newspecies f which is supposed not to have diverged much in character but to have retained the form of f either unaltered or altered onlyin a slight degree in this case its affinities to the other fourteennew species will be of a curious and circuitous nature having descendedfrom a form which stood between the two parent species a and i now supposed to be extinct and unknown it will be in some degreeintermediate in character between the two groups descended from thesespecies but as these two groups have gone on diverging in characterfrom the type of their parents the new species f will not bedirectly intermediate between them but rather between types of the twogroups and every naturalist will be able to bring some such case beforehis mind in the diagram each horizontal line has hitherto been supposed torepresent a thousand generations but each may represent a million orhundred million generations and likewise a section of the successivestrata of the earth s crust including extinct remains we shall when wecome to our chapter on geology have to refer again to this subject and i think we shall then see that the diagram throws light on theaffinities of extinct beings which though generally belonging to thesame orders or families or genera with those now living yet areoften in some degree intermediate in character between existinggroups and we can understand this fact for the extinct species livedat very ancient epochs when the branching lines of descent had divergedless i see no reason to limit the process of modification as now explained to the formation of genera alone if in our diagram we suppose theamount of change represented by each successive group of divergingdotted lines to be very great the forms marked a to p those markedb and f and those marked o to m will form three very distinctgenera we shall also have two very distinct genera descended from i and as these latter two genera both from continued divergence ofcharacter and from inheritance from a different parent will differwidely from the three genera descended from a the two little groupsof genera will form two distinct families or even orders according tothe amount of divergent modification supposed to be represented in thediagram and the two new families or orders will have descended fromtwo species of the original genus and these two species are supposedto have descended from one species of a still more ancient and unknowngenus we have seen that in each country it is the species of the larger generawhich oftenest present varieties or incipient species this indeed might have been expected for as natural selection acts through one formhaving some advantage over other forms in the struggle for existence it will chiefly act on those which already have some advantage andthe largeness of any group shows that its species have inherited froma common ancestor some advantage in common hence the struggle for theproduction of new and modified descendants will mainly lie between thelarger groups which are all trying to increase in number one largegroup will slowly conquer another large group reduce its numbers andthus lessen its chance of further variation and improvement within thesame large group the later and more highly perfected sub groups frombranching out and seizing on many new places in the polity of nature will constantly tend to supplant and destroy the earlier and lessimproved sub groups small and broken groups and sub groups will finallytend to disappear looking to the future we can predict that the groupsof organic beings which are now large and triumphant and which areleast broken up that is which as yet have suffered least extinction will for a long period continue to increase but which groups willultimately prevail no man can predict for we well know that manygroups formerly most extensively developed have now become extinct looking still more remotely to the future we may predict that owing tothe continued and steady increase of the larger groups a multitudeof smaller groups will become utterly extinct and leave no modifieddescendants and consequently that of the species living at any oneperiod extremely few will transmit descendants to a remote futurity ishall have to return to this subject in the chapter on classification but i may add that on this view of extremely few of the more ancientspecies having transmitted descendants and on the view of all thedescendants of the same species making a class we can understand howit is that there exist but very few classes in each main division ofthe animal and vegetable kingdoms although extremely few of the mostancient species may now have living and modified descendants yet at themost remote geological period the earth may have been as well peopledwith many species of many genera families orders and classes as atthe present day summary of chapter if during the long course of ages and under varying conditions of life organic beings vary at all in the several parts of their organisation and i think this cannot be disputed if there be owing to the highgeometrical powers of increase of each species at some age season oryear a severe struggle for life and this certainly cannot be disputed then considering the infinite complexity of the relations of allorganic beings to each other and to their conditions of existence causing an infinite diversity in structure constitution and habits tobe advantageous to them i think it would be a most extraordinary factif no variation ever had occurred useful to each being s own welfare inthe same way as so many variations have occurred useful to man but ifvariations useful to any organic being do occur assuredly individualsthus characterised will have the best chance of being preserved in thestruggle for life and from the strong principle of inheritance theywill tend to produce offspring similarly characterised this principleof preservation i have called for the sake of brevity naturalselection natural selection on the principle of qualities beinginherited at corresponding ages can modify the egg seed or young aseasily as the adult amongst many animals sexual selection will giveits aid to ordinary selection by assuring to the most vigorous and bestadapted males the greatest number of offspring sexual selection willalso give characters useful to the males alone in their struggles withother males whether natural selection has really thus acted in nature in modifyingand adapting the various forms of life to their several conditionsand stations must be judged of by the general tenour and balance ofevidence given in the following chapters but we already see how itentails extinction and how largely extinction has acted in the world shistory geology plainly declares natural selection also leads todivergence of character for more living beings can be supported on thesame area the more they diverge in structure habits and constitution of which we see proof by looking at the inhabitants of any small spotor at naturalised productions therefore during the modification of thedescendants of any one species and during the incessant struggle of allspecies to increase in numbers the more diversified these descendantsbecome the better will be their chance of succeeding in the battle oflife thus the small differences distinguishing varieties of the samespecies will steadily tend to increase till they come to equal thegreater differences between species of the same genus or even ofdistinct genera we have seen that it is the common the widely diffused andwidely ranging species belonging to the larger genera which varymost and these will tend to transmit to their modified offspringthat superiority which now makes them dominant in their own countries natural selection as has just been remarked leads to divergence ofcharacter and to much extinction of the less improved and intermediateforms of life on these principles i believe the nature of theaffinities of all organic beings may be explained it is a trulywonderful fact the wonder of which we are apt to overlook fromfamiliarity that all animals and all plants throughout all time andspace should be related to each other in group subordinate to group in the manner which we everywhere behold namely varieties of the samespecies most closely related together species of the same genus lessclosely and unequally related together forming sections and sub genera species of distinct genera much less closely related and generarelated in different degrees forming sub families families orders sub classes and classes the several subordinate groups in any classcannot be ranked in a single file but seem rather to be clusteredround points and these round other points and so on in almost endlesscycles on the view that each species has been independently created ican see no explanation of this great fact in the classification of allorganic beings but to the best of my judgment it is explained throughinheritance and the complex action of natural selection entailingextinction and divergence of character as we have seen illustrated inthe diagram the affinities of all the beings of the same class have sometimes beenrepresented by a great tree i believe this simile largely speaks thetruth the green and budding twigs may represent existing species andthose produced during each former year may represent the long successionof extinct species at each period of growth all the growing twigshave tried to branch out on all sides and to overtop and kill thesurrounding twigs and branches in the same manner as species and groupsof species have tried to overmaster other species in the great battlefor life the limbs divided into great branches and these into lesserand lesser branches were themselves once when the tree was small budding twigs and this connexion of the former and present buds byramifying branches may well represent the classification of all extinctand living species in groups subordinate to groups of the many twigswhich flourished when the tree was a mere bush only two or three nowgrown into great branches yet survive and bear all the other branches so with the species which lived during long past geological periods very few now have living and modified descendants from the first growthof the tree many a limb and branch has decayed and dropped off andthese lost branches of various sizes may represent those whole orders families and genera which have now no living representatives and whichare known to us only from having been found in a fossil state as wehere and there see a thin straggling branch springing from a fork lowdown in a tree and which by some chance has been favoured and isstill alive on its summit so we occasionally see an animal like theornithorhynchus or lepidosiren which in some small degree connects byits affinities two large branches of life and which has apparently beensaved from fatal competition by having inhabited a protected station asbuds give rise by growth to fresh buds and these if vigorous branchout and overtop on all sides many a feebler branch so by generation ibelieve it has been with the great tree of life which fills with itsdead and broken branches the crust of the earth and covers the surfacewith its ever branching and beautiful ramifications laws of variation effects of external conditions use and disuse combined with naturalselection organs of flight and of vision acclimatisation correlationof growth compensation and economy of growth false correlations multiple rudimentary and lowly organised structures variable partsdeveloped in an unusual manner are highly variable specific charactersmore variable than generic secondary sexual characters variable species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner reversions tolong lost characters summary i have hitherto sometimes spoken as if the variations so common andmultiform in organic beings under domestication and in a lesser degreein those in a state of nature had been due to chance this of course is a wholly incorrect expression but it serves to acknowledge plainlyour ignorance of the cause of each particular variation some authorsbelieve it to be as much the function of the reproductive system toproduce individual differences or very slight deviations of structure as to make the child like its parents but the much greater variability as well as the greater frequency of monstrosities under domesticationor cultivation than under nature leads me to believe that deviationsof structure are in some way due to the nature of the conditions oflife to which the parents and their more remote ancestors have beenexposed during several generations i have remarked in the firstchapter but a long catalogue of facts which cannot be here given wouldbe necessary to show the truth of the remark that the reproductivesystem is eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life and to this system being functionally disturbed in the parents ichiefly attribute the varying or plastic condition of the offspring themale and female sexual elements seem to be affected before that uniontakes place which is to form a new being in the case of sporting plants the bud which in its earliest condition does not apparentlydiffer essentially from an ovule is alone affected but why becausethe reproductive system is disturbed this or that part should vary moreor less we are profoundly ignorant nevertheless we can here and theredimly catch a faint ray of light and we may feel sure that there mustbe some cause for each deviation of structure however slight how much direct effect difference of climate food etc produces onany being is extremely doubtful my impression is that the effect isextremely small in the case of animals but perhaps rather more in thatof plants we may at least safely conclude that such influences cannothave produced the many striking and complex co adaptations of structurebetween one organic being and another which we see everywherethroughout nature some little influence may be attributed to climate food etc thus e forbes speaks confidently that shells at theirsouthern limit and when living in shallow water are more brightlycoloured than those of the same species further north or from greaterdepths gould believes that birds of the same species are more brightlycoloured under a clear atmosphere than when living on islands or nearthe coast so with insects wollaston is convinced that residence nearthe sea affects their colours moquin tandon gives a list of plantswhich when growing near the sea shore have their leaves in some degreefleshy though not elsewhere fleshy several other such cases could begiven the fact of varieties of one species when they range into the zone ofhabitation of other species often acquiring in a very slight degreesome of the characters of such species accords with our view thatspecies of all kinds are only well marked and permanent varieties thusthe species of shells which are confined to tropical and shallow seasare generally brighter coloured than those confined to cold and deeperseas the birds which are confined to continents are according tomr gould brighter coloured than those of islands the insect speciesconfined to sea coasts as every collector knows are often brassy orlurid plants which live exclusively on the sea side are very apt tohave fleshy leaves he who believes in the creation of each species will have to say that this shell for instance was created with brightcolours for a warm sea but that this other shell became bright colouredby variation when it ranged into warmer or shallower waters when a variation is of the slightest use to a being we cannot tell howmuch of it to attribute to the accumulative action of natural selection and how much to the conditions of life thus it is well known tofurriers that animals of the same species have thicker and better furthe more severe the climate is under which they have lived but whocan tell how much of this difference may be due to the warmest cladindividuals having been favoured and preserved during many generations and how much to the direct action of the severe climate for it wouldappear that climate has some direct action on the hair of our domesticquadrupeds instances could be given of the same variety being produced underconditions of life as different as can well be conceived and on theother hand of different varieties being produced from the same speciesunder the same conditions such facts show how indirectly the conditionsof life must act again innumerable instances are known to everynaturalist of species keeping true or not varying at all althoughliving under the most opposite climates such considerations as theseincline me to lay very little weight on the direct action of theconditions of life indirectly as already remarked they seem to playan important part in affecting the reproductive system and in thusinducing variability and natural selection will then accumulateall profitable variations however slight until they become plainlydeveloped and appreciable by us effects of use and disuse from the facts alluded to in the first chapter i think there can belittle doubt that use in our domestic animals strengthens and enlargescertain parts and disuse diminishes them and that such modificationsare inherited under free nature we can have no standard of comparison by which to judge of the effects of long continued use or disuse for weknow not the parent forms but many animals have structures which canbe explained by the effects of disuse as professor owen has remarked there is no greater anomaly in nature than a bird that cannot fly yetthere are several in this state the logger headed duck of south americacan only flap along the surface of the water and has its wings innearly the same condition as the domestic aylesbury duck as the largerground feeding birds seldom take flight except to escape danger ibelieve that the nearly wingless condition of several birds which nowinhabit or have lately inhabited several oceanic islands tenanted byno beast of prey has been caused by disuse the ostrich indeed inhabitscontinents and is exposed to danger from which it cannot escape byflight but by kicking it can defend itself from enemies as well as anyof the smaller quadrupeds we may imagine that the early progenitorof the ostrich had habits like those of a bustard and that as naturalselection increased in successive generations the size and weight ofits body its legs were used more and its wings less until they becameincapable of flight kirby has remarked and i have observed the same fact that the anteriortarsi or feet of many male dung feeding beetles are very often brokenoff he examined seventeen specimens in his own collection and not onehad even a relic left in the onites apelles the tarsi are so habituallylost that the insect has been described as not having them in someother genera they are present but in a rudimentary condition in theateuchus or sacred beetle of the egyptians they are totally deficient there is not sufficient evidence to induce us to believe thatmutilations are ever inherited and i should prefer explaining theentire absence of the anterior tarsi in ateuchus and their rudimentarycondition in some other genera by the long continued effects of disusein their progenitors for as the tarsi are almost always lost in manydung feeding beetles they must be lost early in life and thereforecannot be much used by these insects in some cases we might easily put down to disuse modifications ofstructure which are wholly or mainly due to natural selection mr wollaston has discovered the remarkable fact that beetles out ofthe species inhabiting madeira are so far deficient in wings thatthey cannot fly and that of the twenty nine endemic genera no lessthan twenty three genera have all their species in this condition several facts namely that beetles in many parts of the world are veryfrequently blown to sea and perish that the beetles in madeira asobserved by mr wollaston lie much concealed until the wind lulls andthe sun shines that the proportion of wingless beetles is larger onthe exposed dezertas than in madeira itself and especially theextraordinary fact so strongly insisted on by mr wollaston of thealmost entire absence of certain large groups of beetles elsewhereexcessively numerous and which groups have habits of life almostnecessitating frequent flight these several considerations have mademe believe that the wingless condition of so many madeira beetles ismainly due to the action of natural selection but combined probablywith disuse for during thousands of successive generations eachindividual beetle which flew least either from its wings having beenever so little less perfectly developed or from indolent habit willhave had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea and on the other hand those beetles which most readily took to flightwill oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed the insects in madeira which are not ground feeders and which as theflower feeding coleoptera and lepidoptera must habitually use theirwings to gain their subsistence have as mr wollaston suspects theirwings not at all reduced but even enlarged this is quite compatiblewith the action of natural selection for when a new insect firstarrived on the island the tendency of natural selection to enlargeor to reduce the wings would depend on whether a greater number ofindividuals were saved by successfully battling with the winds orby giving up the attempt and rarely or never flying as with marinersshipwrecked near a coast it would have been better for the goodswimmers if they had been able to swim still further whereas it wouldhave been better for the bad swimmers if they had not been able to swimat all and had stuck to the wreck the eyes of moles and of some burrowing rodents are rudimentary in size and in some cases are quite covered up by skin and fur this state ofthe eyes is probably due to gradual reduction from disuse but aidedperhaps by natural selection in south america a burrowing rodent thetuco tuco or ctenomys is even more subterranean in its habits than themole and i was assured by a spaniard who had often caught them thatthey were frequently blind one which i kept alive was certainly inthis condition the cause as appeared on dissection having beeninflammation of the nictitating membrane as frequent inflammation ofthe eyes must be injurious to any animal and as eyes are certainly notindispensable to animals with subterranean habits a reduction in theirsize with the adhesion of the eyelids and growth of fur over them might in such case be an advantage and if so natural selection wouldconstantly aid the effects of disuse it is well known that several animals belonging to the most differentclasses which inhabit the caves of styria and of kentucky are blind in some of the crabs the foot stalk for the eye remains though the eyeis gone the stand for the telescope is there though the telescopewith its glasses has been lost as it is difficult to imagine thateyes though useless could be in any way injurious to animals living indarkness i attribute their loss wholly to disuse in one of theblind animals namely the cave rat the eyes are of immense size andprofessor silliman thought that it regained after living some days inthe light some slight power of vision in the same manner as in madeirathe wings of some of the insects have been enlarged and the wings ofothers have been reduced by natural selection aided by use and disuse so in the case of the cave rat natural selection seems to have struggledwith the loss of light and to have increased the size of the eyes whereas with all the other inhabitants of the caves disuse by itselfseems to have done its work it is difficult to imagine conditions of life more similar than deeplimestone caverns under a nearly similar climate so that on thecommon view of the blind animals having been separately created for theamerican and european caverns close similarity in their organisationand affinities might have been expected but as schiodte and othershave remarked this is not the case and the cave insects of the twocontinents are not more closely allied than might have been anticipatedfrom the general resemblance of the other inhabitants of north americaand europe on my view we must suppose that american animals havingordinary powers of vision slowly migrated by successive generationsfrom the outer world into the deeper and deeper recesses of the kentuckycaves as did european animals into the caves of europe we have someevidence of this gradation of habit for as schiodte remarks animalsnot far remote from ordinary forms prepare the transition from light todarkness next follow those that are constructed for twilight and lastof all those destined for total darkness by the time that an animalhad reached after numberless generations the deepest recesses disusewill on this view have more or less perfectly obliterated its eyes andnatural selection will often have effected other changes such as anincrease in the length of the antennae or palpi as a compensation forblindness notwithstanding such modifications we might expect still tosee in the cave animals of america affinities to the other inhabitantsof that continent and in those of europe to the inhabitants of theeuropean continent and this is the case with some of the americancave animals as i hear from professor dana and some of the europeancave insects are very closely allied to those of the surroundingcountry it would be most difficult to give any rational explanation ofthe affinities of the blind cave animals to the other inhabitants of thetwo continents on the ordinary view of their independent creation thatseveral of the inhabitants of the caves of the old and new worlds shouldbe closely related we might expect from the well known relationship ofmost of their other productions far from feeling any surprise that someof the cave animals should be very anomalous as agassiz has remarkedin regard to the blind fish the amblyopsis and as is the case withthe blind proteus with reference to the reptiles of europe i am onlysurprised that more wrecks of ancient life have not been preserved owing to the less severe competition to which the inhabitants of thesedark abodes will probably have been exposed acclimatisation habit is hereditary with plants as in the period of flowering in theamount of rain requisite for seeds to germinate in the time of sleep etc and this leads me to say a few words on acclimatisation as it isextremely common for species of the same genus to inhabit very hot andvery cold countries and as i believe that all the species of the samegenus have descended from a single parent if this view be correct acclimatisation must be readily effected during long continued descent it is notorious that each species is adapted to the climate of its ownhome species from an arctic or even from a temperate region cannotendure a tropical climate or conversely so again many succulentplants cannot endure a damp climate but the degree of adaptation ofspecies to the climates under which they live is often overrated wemay infer this from our frequent inability to predict whether or not animported plant will endure our climate and from the number of plantsand animals brought from warmer countries which here enjoy good health we have reason to believe that species in a state of nature are limitedin their ranges by the competition of other organic beings quite as muchas or more than by adaptation to particular climates but whether ornot the adaptation be generally very close we have evidence inthe case of some few plants of their becoming to a certainextent naturally habituated to different temperatures or becomingacclimatised thus the pines and rhododendrons raised from seedcollected by dr hooker from trees growing at different heights on thehimalaya were found in this country to possess different constitutionalpowers of resisting cold mr thwaites informs me that he has observedsimilar facts in ceylon and analogous observations have been made bymr h c watson on european species of plants brought from the azoresto england in regard to animals several authentic cases could be givenof species within historical times having largely extended theirrange from warmer to cooler latitudes and conversely but we do notpositively know that these animals were strictly adapted to their nativeclimate but in all ordinary cases we assume such to be the case nordo we know that they have subsequently become acclimatised to their newhomes as i believe that our domestic animals were originally chosen byuncivilised man because they were useful and bred readily underconfinement and not because they were subsequently found capableof far extended transportation i think the common and extraordinarycapacity in our domestic animals of not only withstanding the mostdifferent climates but of being perfectly fertile a far severer test under them may be used as an argument that a large proportion of otheranimals now in a state of nature could easily be brought to bearwidely different climates we must not however push the foregoingargument too far on account of the probable origin of some of ourdomestic animals from several wild stocks the blood for instance ofa tropical and arctic wolf or wild dog may perhaps be mingled in ourdomestic breeds the rat and mouse cannot be considered as domesticanimals but they have been transported by man to many parts of theworld and now have a far wider range than any other rodent living freeunder the cold climate of faroe in the north and of the falklands in thesouth and on many islands in the torrid zones hence i am inclined tolook at adaptation to any special climate as a quality readily graftedon an innate wide flexibility of constitution which is common to mostanimals on this view the capacity of enduring the most differentclimates by man himself and by his domestic animals and such factsas that former species of the elephant and rhinoceros were capableof enduring a glacial climate whereas the living species are now alltropical or sub tropical in their habits ought not to be looked atas anomalies but merely as examples of a very common flexibility ofconstitution brought under peculiar circumstances into play how much of the acclimatisation of species to any peculiar climate isdue to mere habit and how much to the natural selection of varietieshaving different innate constitutions and how much to both meanscombined is a very obscure question that habit or custom has someinfluence i must believe both from analogy and from the incessantadvice given in agricultural works even in the ancient encyclopaediasof china to be very cautious in transposing animals from one districtto another for it is not likely that man should have succeeded inselecting so many breeds and sub breeds with constitutions speciallyfitted for their own districts the result must i think be due tohabit on the other hand i can see no reason to doubt that naturalselection will continually tend to preserve those individuals whichare born with constitutions best adapted to their native countries intreatises on many kinds of cultivated plants certain varieties aresaid to withstand certain climates better than others this is verystrikingly shown in works on fruit trees published in the united states in which certain varieties are habitually recommended for the northern and others for the southern states and as most of these varieties areof recent origin they cannot owe their constitutional differences tohabit the case of the jerusalem artichoke which is never propagatedby seed and of which consequently new varieties have not been produced has even been advanced for it is now as tender as ever it was asproving that acclimatisation cannot be effected the case also of thekidney bean has been often cited for a similar purpose and withmuch greater weight but until some one will sow during a score ofgenerations his kidney beans so early that a very large proportion aredestroyed by frost and then collect seed from the few survivors withcare to prevent accidental crosses and then again get seed from theseseedlings with the same precautions the experiment cannot be said tohave been even tried nor let it be supposed that no differences in theconstitution of seedling kidney beans ever appear for an account hasbeen published how much more hardy some seedlings appeared to be thanothers on the whole i think we may conclude that habit use and disuse have in some cases played a considerable part in the modification of theconstitution and of the structure of various organs but that theeffects of use and disuse have often been largely combined with andsometimes overmastered by the natural selection of innate differences correlation of growth i mean by this expression that the whole organisation is so tiedtogether during its growth and development that when slight variationsin any one part occur and are accumulated through natural selection other parts become modified this is a very important subject mostimperfectly understood the most obvious case is that modificationsaccumulated solely for the good of the young or larva will it maysafely be concluded affect the structure of the adult in the samemanner as any malconformation affecting the early embryo seriouslyaffects the whole organisation of the adult the several parts of thebody which are homologous and which at an early embryonic period arealike seem liable to vary in an allied manner we see this in the rightand left sides of the body varying in the same manner in the front andhind legs and even in the jaws and limbs varying together for thelower jaw is believed to be homologous with the limbs these tendencies i do not doubt may be mastered more or less completely by naturalselection thus a family of stags once existed with an antler only onone side and if this had been of any great use to the breed it mightprobably have been rendered permanent by natural selection homologous parts as has been remarked by some authors tend to cohere this is often seen in monstrous plants and nothing is more common thanthe union of homologous parts in normal structures as the union of thepetals of the corolla into a tube hard parts seem to affect the form ofadjoining soft parts it is believed by some authors that the diversityin the shape of the pelvis in birds causes the remarkable diversity inthe shape of their kidneys others believe that the shape of the pelvisin the human mother influences by pressure the shape of the head of thechild in snakes according to schlegel the shape of the body andthe manner of swallowing determine the position of several of the mostimportant viscera the nature of the bond of correlation is very frequently quite obscure m is geoffroy st hilaire has forcibly remarked that certainmalconformations very frequently and that others rarely coexist without our being able to assign any reason what can be more singularthan the relation between blue eyes and deafness in cats and thetortoise shell colour with the female sex the feathered feet and skinbetween the outer toes in pigeons and the presence of more or less downon the young birds when first hatched with the future colour of theirplumage or again the relation between the hair and teeth in the nakedturkish dog though here probably homology comes into play with respectto this latter case of correlation i think it can hardly be accidental that if we pick out the two orders of mammalia which are mostabnormal in their dermal coverings viz cetacea whales and edentata armadilloes scaly ant eaters etc that these are likewise the mostabnormal in their teeth i know of no case better adapted to show the importance of the laws ofcorrelation in modifying important structures independently of utilityand therefore of natural selection than that of the differencebetween the outer and inner flowers in some compositous andumbelliferous plants every one knows the difference in the ray andcentral florets of for instance the daisy and this difference isoften accompanied with the abortion of parts of the flower but in somecompositous plants the seeds also differ in shape and sculpture andeven the ovary itself with its accessory parts differs as has beendescribed by cassini these differences have been attributed by someauthors to pressure and the shape of the seeds in the ray florets insome compositae countenances this idea but in the case of the corollaof the umbelliferae it is by no means as dr hooker informs me inspecies with the densest heads that the inner and outer flowers mostfrequently differ it might have been thought that the development ofthe ray petals by drawing nourishment from certain other parts of theflower had caused their abortion but in some compositae there is adifference in the seeds of the outer and inner florets without anydifference in the corolla possibly these several differences may beconnected with some difference in the flow of nutriment towards thecentral and external flowers we know at least that in irregularflowers those nearest to the axis are oftenest subject to peloria andbecome regular i may add as an instance of this and of a strikingcase of correlation that i have recently observed in some gardenpelargoniums that the central flower of the truss often loses thepatches of darker colour in the two upper petals and that when thisoccurs the adherent nectary is quite aborted when the colour isabsent from only one of the two upper petals the nectary is only muchshortened with respect to the difference in the corolla of the central andexterior flowers of a head or umbel i do not feel at all sure that c c sprengel s idea that the ray florets serve to attract insects whoseagency is highly advantageous in the fertilisation of plants of thesetwo orders is so far fetched as it may at first appear and if it beadvantageous natural selection may have come into play but in regardto the differences both in the internal and external structure of theseeds which are not always correlated with any differences in theflowers it seems impossible that they can be in any way advantageousto the plant yet in the umbelliferae these differences are of suchapparent importance the seeds being in some cases according to tausch orthospermous in the exterior flowers and coelospermous in the centralflowers that the elder de candolle founded his main divisions ofthe order on analogous differences hence we see that modifications ofstructure viewed by systematists as of high value may be wholly due tounknown laws of correlated growth and without being as far as we cansee of the slightest service to the species we may often falsely attribute to correlation of growth structureswhich are common to whole groups of species and which in truth aresimply due to inheritance for an ancient progenitor may have acquiredthrough natural selection some one modification in structure and afterthousands of generations some other and independent modification andthese two modifications having been transmitted to a whole groupof descendants with diverse habits would naturally be thought to becorrelated in some necessary manner so again i do not doubt that someapparent correlations occurring throughout whole orders are entirelydue to the manner alone in which natural selection can act forinstance alph de candolle has remarked that winged seeds are neverfound in fruits which do not open i should explain the rule by the factthat seeds could not gradually become winged through natural selection except in fruits which opened so that the individual plants producingseeds which were a little better fitted to be wafted further might getan advantage over those producing seed less fitted for dispersal andthis process could not possibly go on in fruit which did not open the elder geoffroy and goethe propounded at about the same period their law of compensation or balancement of growth or as goetheexpressed it in order to spend on one side nature is forced toeconomise on the other side i think this holds true to a certainextent with our domestic productions if nourishment flows to one partor organ in excess it rarely flows at least in excess to anotherpart thus it is difficult to get a cow to give much milk and to fattenreadily the same varieties of the cabbage do not yield abundant andnutritious foliage and a copious supply of oil bearing seeds when theseeds in our fruits become atrophied the fruit itself gains largely insize and quality in our poultry a large tuft of feathers on the headis generally accompanied by a diminished comb and a large beard bydiminished wattles with species in a state of nature it can hardlybe maintained that the law is of universal application but many goodobservers more especially botanists believe in its truth i willnot however here give any instances for i see hardly any way ofdistinguishing between the effects on the one hand of a part beinglargely developed through natural selection and another and adjoiningpart being reduced by this same process or by disuse and on the otherhand the actual withdrawal of nutriment from one part owing to theexcess of growth in another and adjoining part i suspect also that some of the cases of compensation which have beenadvanced and likewise some other facts may be merged under a moregeneral principle namely that natural selection is continuallytrying to economise in every part of the organisation if under changedconditions of life a structure before useful becomes less useful anydiminution however slight in its development will be seized on bynatural selection for it will profit the individual not to have itsnutriment wasted in building up an useless structure i can thusonly understand a fact with which i was much struck when examiningcirripedes and of which many other instances could be given namely that when a cirripede is parasitic within another and is thus protected it loses more or less completely its own shell or carapace this is thecase with the male ibla and in a truly extraordinary manner with theproteolepas for the carapace in all other cirripedes consists ofthe three highly important anterior segments of the head enormouslydeveloped and furnished with great nerves and muscles but in theparasitic and protected proteolepas the whole anterior part of thehead is reduced to the merest rudiment attached to the bases of theprehensile antennae now the saving of a large and complex structure when rendered superfluous by the parasitic habits of the proteolepas though effected by slow steps would be a decided advantage to eachsuccessive individual of the species for in the struggle for life towhich every animal is exposed each individual proteolepas would havea better chance of supporting itself by less nutriment being wasted indeveloping a structure now become useless thus as i believe natural selection will always succeed in the longrun in reducing and saving every part of the organisation as soon as itis rendered superfluous without by any means causing some other partto be largely developed in a corresponding degree and conversely thatnatural selection may perfectly well succeed in largely developing anyorgan without requiring as a necessary compensation the reduction ofsome adjoining part it seems to be a rule as remarked by is geoffroy st hilaire both invarieties and in species that when any part or organ is repeated manytimes in the structure of the same individual as the vertebrae insnakes and the stamens in polyandrous flowers the number is variable whereas the number of the same part or organ when it occurs in lessernumbers is constant the same author and some botanists have furtherremarked that multiple parts are also very liable to variation instructure inasmuch as this vegetative repetition to use professorowen s expression seems to be a sign of low organisation the foregoingremark seems connected with the very general opinion of naturalists that beings low in the scale of nature are more variable than thosewhich are higher i presume that lowness in this case means that theseveral parts of the organisation have been but little specialisedfor particular functions and as long as the same part has to performdiversified work we can perhaps see why it should remain variable thatis why natural selection should have preserved or rejected each littledeviation of form less carefully than when the part has to serve for onespecial purpose alone in the same way that a knife which has to cutall sorts of things may be of almost any shape whilst a tool forsome particular object had better be of some particular shape naturalselection it should never be forgotten can act on each part of eachbeing solely through and for its advantage rudimentary parts it has been stated by some authors and i believewith truth are apt to be highly variable we shall have to recur to thegeneral subject of rudimentary and aborted organs and i will here onlyadd that their variability seems to be owing to their uselessness andtherefore to natural selection having no power to check deviations intheir structure thus rudimentary parts are left to the free play of thevarious laws of growth to the effects of long continued disuse and tothe tendency to reversion a part developed in any species in an extraordinary degree or manner in comparison with the same part in allied species tends to be highlyvariable several years ago i was much struck with a remark nearly to the aboveeffect published by mr waterhouse i infer also from an observationmade by professor owen with respect to the length of the arms of theourang outang that he has come to a nearly similar conclusion it ishopeless to attempt to convince any one of the truth of this propositionwithout giving the long array of facts which i have collected and whichcannot possibly be here introduced i can only state my conviction thatit is a rule of high generality i am aware of several causes oferror but i hope that i have made due allowance for them it shouldbe understood that the rule by no means applies to any part howeverunusually developed unless it be unusually developed in comparison withthe same part in closely allied species thus the bat s wing is a mostabnormal structure in the class mammalia but the rule would not hereapply because there is a whole group of bats having wings it wouldapply only if some one species of bat had its wings developed in someremarkable manner in comparison with the other species of the samegenus the rule applies very strongly in the case of secondary sexualcharacters when displayed in any unusual manner the term secondarysexual characters used by hunter applies to characters which areattached to one sex but are not directly connected with the act ofreproduction the rule applies to males and females but as females morerarely offer remarkable secondary sexual characters it applies morerarely to them the rule being so plainly applicable in the case ofsecondary sexual characters may be due to the great variability ofthese characters whether or not displayed in any unusual manner ofwhich fact i think there can be little doubt but that our rule is notconfined to secondary sexual characters is clearly shown in the caseof hermaphrodite cirripedes and i may here add that i particularlyattended to mr waterhouse s remark whilst investigating this order and i am fully convinced that the rule almost invariably holds goodwith cirripedes i shall in my future work give a list of the moreremarkable cases i will here only briefly give one as it illustratesthe rule in its largest application the opercular valves of sessilecirripedes rock barnacles are in every sense of the word veryimportant structures and they differ extremely little even in differentgenera but in the several species of one genus pyrgoma these valvespresent a marvellous amount of diversification the homologous valvesin the different species being sometimes wholly unlike in shape and theamount of variation in the individuals of several of the species is sogreat that it is no exaggeration to state that the varieties differmore from each other in the characters of these important valves than doother species of distinct genera as birds within the same country vary in a remarkably small degree ihave particularly attended to them and the rule seems to me certainlyto hold good in this class i cannot make out that it applies to plants and this would seriously have shaken my belief in its truth had not thegreat variability in plants made it particularly difficult to comparetheir relative degrees of variability when we see any part or organ developed in a remarkable degree or mannerin any species the fair presumption is that it is of high importance tothat species nevertheless the part in this case is eminently liable tovariation why should this be so on the view that each species has beenindependently created with all its parts as we now see them i can seeno explanation but on the view that groups of species have descendedfrom other species and have been modified through natural selection ithink we can obtain some light in our domestic animals if any part or the whole animal be neglected and no selection be applied that part for instance the comb in the dorking fowl or the whole breed willcease to have a nearly uniform character the breed will then be saidto have degenerated in rudimentary organs and in those which havebeen but little specialised for any particular purpose and perhaps inpolymorphic groups we see a nearly parallel natural case for in suchcases natural selection either has not or cannot come into full play and thus the organisation is left in a fluctuating condition but whathere more especially concerns us is that in our domestic animalsthose points which at the present time are undergoing rapid change bycontinued selection are also eminently liable to variation look at thebreeds of the pigeon see what a prodigious amount of difference thereis in the beak of the different tumblers in the beak and wattle ofthe different carriers in the carriage and tail of our fantails etc these being the points now mainly attended to by english fanciers evenin the sub breeds as in the short faced tumbler it is notoriouslydifficult to breed them nearly to perfection and frequently individualsare born which depart widely from the standard there may be trulysaid to be a constant struggle going on between on the one hand thetendency to reversion to a less modified state as well as an innatetendency to further variability of all kinds and on the other hand the power of steady selection to keep the breed true in the long runselection gains the day and we do not expect to fail so far as to breeda bird as coarse as a common tumbler from a good short faced strain butas long as selection is rapidly going on there may always be expectedto be much variability in the structure undergoing modification itfurther deserves notice that these variable characters produced byman s selection sometimes become attached from causes quite unknownto us more to one sex than to the other generally to the male sex aswith the wattle of carriers and the enlarged crop of pouters now let us turn to nature when a part has been developed in anextraordinary manner in any one species compared with the other speciesof the same genus we may conclude that this part has undergone anextraordinary amount of modification since the period when the speciesbranched off from the common progenitor of the genus this period willseldom be remote in any extreme degree as species very rarely endurefor more than one geological period an extraordinary amount ofmodification implies an unusually large and long continued amount ofvariability which has continually been accumulated by naturalselection for the benefit of the species but as the variability ofthe extraordinarily developed part or organ has been so great andlong continued within a period not excessively remote we might as ageneral rule expect still to find more variability in such parts thanin other parts of the organisation which have remained for a muchlonger period nearly constant and this i am convinced is the case that the struggle between natural selection on the one hand and thetendency to reversion and variability on the other hand will in thecourse of time cease and that the most abnormally developed organs maybe made constant i can see no reason to doubt hence when an organ however abnormal it may be has been transmitted in approximately thesame condition to many modified descendants as in the case of the wingof the bat it must have existed according to my theory for animmense period in nearly the same state and thus it comes to be no morevariable than any other structure it is only in those cases in whichthe modification has been comparatively recent and extraordinarily greatthat we ought to find the generative variability as it may be called still present in a high degree for in this case the variabilitywill seldom as yet have been fixed by the continued selection of theindividuals varying in the required manner and degree and by thecontinued rejection of those tending to revert to a former and lessmodified condition the principle included in these remarks may be extended it is notoriousthat specific characters are more variable than generic to explain by asimple example what is meant if some species in a large genus of plantshad blue flowers and some had red the colour would be only a specificcharacter and no one would be surprised at one of the blue speciesvarying into red or conversely but if all the species had blueflowers the colour would become a generic character and its variationwould be a more unusual circumstance i have chosen this example becausean explanation is not in this case applicable which most naturalistswould advance namely that specific characters are more variablethan generic because they are taken from parts of less physiologicalimportance than those commonly used for classing genera i believe thisexplanation is partly yet only indirectly true i shall however haveto return to this subject in our chapter on classification it would bealmost superfluous to adduce evidence in support of the above statement that specific characters are more variable than generic but i haverepeatedly noticed in works on natural history that when an authorhas remarked with surprise that some important organ or part which isgenerally very constant throughout large groups of species has differedconsiderably in closely allied species that it has also been variablein the individuals of some of the species and this fact shows that acharacter which is generally of generic value when it sinks in valueand becomes only of specific value often becomes variable though itsphysiological importance may remain the same something of the same kindapplies to monstrosities at least is geoffroy st hilaire seems toentertain no doubt that the more an organ normally differs inthe different species of the same group the more subject it is toindividual anomalies on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why should that part of the structure which differs from the samepart in other independently created species of the same genus bemore variable than those parts which are closely alike in the severalspecies i do not see that any explanation can be given but on theview of species being only strongly marked and fixed varieties we mightsurely expect to find them still often continuing to vary in those partsof their structure which have varied within a moderately recent period and which have thus come to differ or to state the case in anothermanner the points in which all the species of a genus resemble eachother and in which they differ from the species of some other genus are called generic characters and these characters in common iattribute to inheritance from a common progenitor for it can rarelyhave happened that natural selection will have modified several species fitted to more or less widely different habits in exactly the samemanner and as these so called generic characters have been inheritedfrom a remote period since that period when the species first branchedoff from their common progenitor and subsequently have not varied orcome to differ in any degree or only in a slight degree it is notprobable that they should vary at the present day on the other hand the points in which species differ from other species of the same genus are called specific characters and as these specific characters havevaried and come to differ within the period of the branching off of thespecies from a common progenitor it is probable that they should stilloften be in some degree variable at least more variable than thoseparts of the organisation which have for a very long period remainedconstant in connexion with the present subject i will make only two otherremarks i think it will be admitted without my entering on details that secondary sexual characters are very variable i think it also willbe admitted that species of the same group differ from each other morewidely in their secondary sexual characters than in other parts oftheir organisation compare for instance the amount of differencebetween the males of gallinaceous birds in which secondary sexualcharacters are strongly displayed with the amount of difference betweentheir females and the truth of this proposition will be granted thecause of the original variability of secondary sexual characters isnot manifest but we can see why these characters should not have beenrendered as constant and uniform as other parts of the organisation forsecondary sexual characters have been accumulated by sexual selection which is less rigid in its action than ordinary selection as it doesnot entail death but only gives fewer offspring to the less favouredmales whatever the cause may be of the variability of secondary sexualcharacters as they are highly variable sexual selection will have hada wide scope for action and may thus readily have succeeded in givingto the species of the same group a greater amount of difference in theirsexual characters than in other parts of their structure it is a remarkable fact that the secondary sexual differences betweenthe two sexes of the same species are generally displayed in the verysame parts of the organisation in which the different species ofthe same genus differ from each other of this fact i will give inillustration two instances the first which happen to stand on my list and as the differences in these cases are of a very unusual nature the relation can hardly be accidental the same number of joints in thetarsi is a character generally common to very large groups of beetles but in the engidae as westwood has remarked the number varies greatly and the number likewise differs in the two sexes of the same species again in fossorial hymenoptera the manner of neuration of the wings isa character of the highest importance because common to large groups but in certain genera the neuration differs in the different species and likewise in the two sexes of the same species this relation has aclear meaning on my view of the subject i look at all the speciesof the same genus as having as certainly descended from the sameprogenitor as have the two sexes of any one of the species consequently whatever part of the structure of the common progenitor or of its early descendants became variable variations of this partwould it is highly probable be taken advantage of by natural and sexualselection in order to fit the several species to their several placesin the economy of nature and likewise to fit the two sexes of the samespecies to each other or to fit the males and females to differenthabits of life or the males to struggle with other males for thepossession of the females finally then i conclude that the greater variability of specificcharacters or those which distinguish species from species than ofgeneric characters or those which the species possess in common thatthe frequent extreme variability of any part which is developed in aspecies in an extraordinary manner in comparison with the same partin its congeners and the not great degree of variability in a part however extraordinarily it may be developed if it be common to awhole group of species that the great variability of secondary sexualcharacters and the great amount of difference in these same charactersbetween closely allied species that secondary sexual and ordinaryspecific differences are generally displayed in the same parts of theorganisation are all principles closely connected together all beingmainly due to the species of the same group having descended from acommon progenitor from whom they have inherited much in common toparts which have recently and largely varied being more likely stillto go on varying than parts which have long been inherited and have notvaried to natural selection having more or less completely accordingto the lapse of time overmastered the tendency to reversion and tofurther variability to sexual selection being less rigid than ordinaryselection and to variations in the same parts having been accumulatedby natural and sexual selection and thus adapted for secondary sexual and for ordinary specific purposes distinct species present analogous variations and a variety of onespecies often assumes some of the characters of an allied species orreverts to some of the characters of an early progenitor these propositions will be most readily understood by looking to ourdomestic races the most distinct breeds of pigeons in countries mostwidely apart present sub varieties with reversed feathers on the headand feathers on the feet characters not possessed by the aboriginalrock pigeon these then are analogous variations in two or more distinctraces the frequent presence of fourteen or even sixteen tail feathersin the pouter may be considered as a variation representing the normalstructure of another race the fantail i presume that no one will doubtthat all such analogous variations are due to the several races of thepigeon having inherited from a common parent the same constitution andtendency to variation when acted on by similar unknown influences in the vegetable kingdom we have a case of analogous variation in theenlarged stems or roots as commonly called of the swedish turnip andruta baga plants which several botanists rank as varieties produced bycultivation from a common parent if this be not so the case will thenbe one of analogous variation in two so called distinct species and tothese a third may be added namely the common turnip according tothe ordinary view of each species having been independently created weshould have to attribute this similarity in the enlarged stems of thesethree plants not to the vera causa of community of descent and aconsequent tendency to vary in a like manner but to three separate yetclosely related acts of creation with pigeons however we have another case namely the occasionalappearance in all the breeds of slaty blue birds with two black barson the wings a white rump a bar at the end of the tail with the outerfeathers externally edged near their bases with white as all thesemarks are characteristic of the parent rock pigeon i presume that noone will doubt that this is a case of reversion and not of a new yetanalogous variation appearing in the several breeds we may i thinkconfidently come to this conclusion because as we have seen thesecoloured marks are eminently liable to appear in the crossed offspringof two distinct and differently coloured breeds and in this case thereis nothing in the external conditions of life to cause the reappearanceof the slaty blue with the several marks beyond the influence of themere act of crossing on the laws of inheritance no doubt it is a very surprising fact that characters should reappearafter having been lost for many perhaps for hundreds of generations but when a breed has been crossed only once by some other breed theoffspring occasionally show a tendency to revert in character to theforeign breed for many generations some say for a dozen or even ascore of generations after twelve generations the proportion of blood to use a common expression of any one ancestor is only in andyet as we see it is generally believed that a tendency to reversionis retained by this very small proportion of foreign blood in a breedwhich has not been crossed but in which both parents have lost somecharacter which their progenitor possessed the tendency whether strongor weak to reproduce the lost character might be as was formerlyremarked for all that we can see to the contrary transmitted foralmost any number of generations when a character which has been lostin a breed reappears after a great number of generations the mostprobable hypothesis is not that the offspring suddenly takes after anancestor some hundred generations distant but that in each successivegeneration there has been a tendency to reproduce the character inquestion which at last under unknown favourable conditions gains anascendancy for instance it is probable that in each generation of thebarb pigeon which produces most rarely a blue and black barred bird there has been a tendency in each generation in the plumage to assumethis colour this view is hypothetical but could be supported by somefacts and i can see no more abstract improbability in a tendencyto produce any character being inherited for an endless number ofgenerations than in quite useless or rudimentary organs being as weall know them to be thus inherited indeed we may sometimes observea mere tendency to produce a rudiment inherited for instance in thecommon snapdragon antirrhinum a rudiment of a fifth stamen so oftenappears that this plant must have an inherited tendency to produce it as all the species of the same genus are supposed on my theory to havedescended from a common parent it might be expected that they wouldoccasionally vary in an analogous manner so that a variety of onespecies would resemble in some of its characters another species thisother species being on my view only a well marked and permanent variety but characters thus gained would probably be of an unimportant nature for the presence of all important characters will be governed by naturalselection in accordance with the diverse habits of the species andwill not be left to the mutual action of the conditions of life and ofa similar inherited constitution it might further be expected that thespecies of the same genus would occasionally exhibit reversions to lostancestral characters as however we never know the exact characterof the common ancestor of a group we could not distinguish these twocases if for instance we did not know that the rock pigeon was notfeather footed or turn crowned we could not have told whether thesecharacters in our domestic breeds were reversions or only analogousvariations but we might have inferred that the blueness was a case ofreversion from the number of the markings which are correlated withthe blue tint and which it does not appear probable would all appeartogether from simple variation more especially we might have inferredthis from the blue colour and marks so often appearing when distinctbreeds of diverse colours are crossed hence though under natureit must generally be left doubtful what cases are reversions to ananciently existing character and what are new but analogous variations yet we ought on my theory sometimes to find the varying offspring ofa species assuming characters either from reversion or from analogousvariation which already occur in some other members of the same group and this undoubtedly is the case in nature a considerable part of the difficulty in recognising a variable speciesin our systematic works is due to its varieties mocking as it were some of the other species of the same genus a considerable catalogue also could be given of forms intermediate between two other forms which themselves must be doubtfully ranked as either varieties orspecies and this shows unless all these forms be considered asindependently created species that the one in varying has assumed someof the characters of the other so as to produce the intermediate form but the best evidence is afforded by parts or organs of an important anduniform nature occasionally varying so as to acquire in some degree the character of the same part or organ in an allied species i havecollected a long list of such cases but here as before i lie undera great disadvantage in not being able to give them i can only repeatthat such cases certainly do occur and seem to me very remarkable i will however give one curious and complex case not indeed asaffecting any important character but from occurring in several speciesof the same genus partly under domestication and partly under nature it is a case apparently of reversion the ass not rarely has verydistinct transverse bars on its legs like those on the legs of a zebra it has been asserted that these are plainest in the foal and frominquiries which i have made i believe this to be true it has alsobeen asserted that the stripe on each shoulder is sometimes double the shoulder stripe is certainly very variable in length and outline awhite ass but not an albino has been described without either spinalor shoulder stripe and these stripes are sometimes very obscure oractually quite lost in dark coloured asses the koulan of pallas issaid to have been seen with a double shoulder stripe the hemionus hasno shoulder stripe but traces of it as stated by mr blyth and others occasionally appear and i have been informed by colonel poole that thefoals of this species are generally striped on the legs and faintly onthe shoulder the quagga though so plainly barred like a zebra over thebody is without bars on the legs but dr gray has figured one specimenwith very distinct zebra like bars on the hocks with respect to the horse i have collected cases in england of thespinal stripe in horses of the most distinct breeds and of all colours transverse bars on the legs are not rare in duns mouse duns and in oneinstance in a chestnut a faint shoulder stripe may sometimes be seenin duns and i have seen a trace in a bay horse my son made a carefulexamination and sketch for me of a dun belgian cart horse with a doublestripe on each shoulder and with leg stripes and a man whom i canimplicitly trust has examined for me a small dun welch pony with threeshort parallel stripes on each shoulder in the north west part of india the kattywar breed of horses is sogenerally striped that as i hear from colonel poole who examinedthe breed for the indian government a horse without stripes is notconsidered as purely bred the spine is always striped the legs aregenerally barred and the shoulder stripe which is sometimes doubleand sometimes treble is common the side of the face moreover issometimes striped the stripes are plainest in the foal and sometimesquite disappear in old horses colonel poole has seen both gray andbay kattywar horses striped when first foaled i have also reason tosuspect from information given me by mr w w edwards that with theenglish race horse the spinal stripe is much commoner in the foal thanin the full grown animal without here entering on further details imay state that i have collected cases of leg and shoulder stripes inhorses of very different breeds in various countries from britain toeastern china and from norway in the north to the malay archipelago inthe south in all parts of the world these stripes occur far oftenestin duns and mouse duns by the term dun a large range of colour isincluded from one between brown and black to a close approach tocream colour i am aware that colonel hamilton smith who has written on this subject believes that the several breeds of the horse have descended fromseveral aboriginal species one of which the dun was striped and thatthe above described appearances are all due to ancient crosses with thedun stock but i am not at all satisfied with this theory and should beloth to apply it to breeds so distinct as the heavy belgian cart horse welch ponies cobs the lanky kattywar race etc inhabiting the mostdistant parts of the world now let us turn to the effects of crossing the several species of thehorse genus rollin asserts that the common mule from the ass and horseis particularly apt to have bars on its legs i once saw a mule with itslegs so much striped that any one at first would have thought that itmust have been the product of a zebra and mr w c martin in hisexcellent treatise on the horse has given a figure of a similar mule in four coloured drawings which i have seen of hybrids between the assand zebra the legs were much more plainly barred than the rest of thebody and in one of them there was a double shoulder stripe in lordmoreton s famous hybrid from a chestnut mare and male quagga thehybrid and even the pure offspring subsequently produced from the mareby a black arabian sire were much more plainly barred across thelegs than is even the pure quagga lastly and this is another mostremarkable case a hybrid has been figured by dr gray and he informsme that he knows of a second case from the ass and the hemionus andthis hybrid though the ass seldom has stripes on its legs and thehemionus has none and has not even a shoulder stripe nevertheless hadall four legs barred and had three short shoulder stripes like thoseon the dun welch pony and even had some zebra like stripes on the sidesof its face with respect to this last fact i was so convinced that noteven a stripe of colour appears from what would commonly be called anaccident that i was led solely from the occurrence of the face stripeson this hybrid from the ass and hemionus to ask colonel poole whethersuch face stripes ever occur in the eminently striped kattywar breed ofhorses and was as we have seen answered in the affirmative what now are we to say to these several facts we see several verydistinct species of the horse genus becoming by simple variation striped on the legs like a zebra or striped on the shoulders likean ass in the horse we see this tendency strong whenever a dun tintappears a tint which approaches to that of the general colouring ofthe other species of the genus the appearance of the stripes is notaccompanied by any change of form or by any other new character we seethis tendency to become striped most strongly displayed in hybrids frombetween several of the most distinct species now observe the caseof the several breeds of pigeons they are descended from a pigeon including two or three sub species or geographical races of a bluishcolour with certain bars and other marks and when any breed assumesby simple variation a bluish tint these bars and other marks invariablyreappear but without any other change of form or character when theoldest and truest breeds of various colours are crossed we see astrong tendency for the blue tint and bars and marks to reappear in themongrels i have stated that the most probable hypothesis to accountfor the reappearance of very ancient characters is that there isa tendency in the young of each successive generation to produce thelong lost character and that this tendency from unknown causes sometimes prevails and we have just seen that in several species of thehorse genus the stripes are either plainer or appear more commonly inthe young than in the old call the breeds of pigeons some of whichhave bred true for centuries species and how exactly parallel is thecase with that of the species of the horse genus for myself i ventureconfidently to look back thousands on thousands of generations andi see an animal striped like a zebra but perhaps otherwise verydifferently constructed the common parent of our domestic horse whether or not it be descended from one or more wild stocks of the ass the hemionus quagga and zebra he who believes that each equine species was independently created will i presume assert that each species has been created with atendency to vary both under nature and under domestication in thisparticular manner so as often to become striped like other species ofthe genus and that each has been created with a strong tendency when crossed with species inhabiting distant quarters of the world toproduce hybrids resembling in their stripes not their own parents butother species of the genus to admit this view is as it seems to me toreject a real for an unreal or at least for an unknown cause it makesthe works of god a mere mockery and deception i would almost as soonbelieve with the old and ignorant cosmogonists that fossil shells hadnever lived but had been created in stone so as to mock the shells nowliving on the sea shore summary our ignorance of the laws of variation is profound not in one case outof a hundred can we pretend to assign any reason why this or that partdiffers more or less from the same part in the parents but wheneverwe have the means of instituting a comparison the same laws appear tohave acted in producing the lesser differences between varieties of thesame species and the greater differences between species of the samegenus the external conditions of life as climate and food etc seem to have induced some slight modifications habit in producingconstitutional differences and use in strengthening and disuse inweakening and diminishing organs seem to have been more potent in theireffects homologous parts tend to vary in the same way and homologousparts tend to cohere modifications in hard parts and in external partssometimes affect softer and internal parts when one part is largelydeveloped perhaps it tends to draw nourishment from the adjoiningparts and every part of the structure which can be saved withoutdetriment to the individual will be saved changes of structure at anearly age will generally affect parts subsequently developed and thereare very many other correlations of growth the nature of which we areutterly unable to understand multiple parts are variable in number andin structure perhaps arising from such parts not having been closelyspecialised to any particular function so that their modifications havenot been closely checked by natural selection it is probably fromthis same cause that organic beings low in the scale of nature aremore variable than those which have their whole organisation morespecialised and are higher in the scale rudimentary organs from beinguseless will be disregarded by natural selection and hence probablyare variable specific characters that is the characters which havecome to differ since the several species of the same genus branchedoff from a common parent are more variable than generic characters orthose which have long been inherited and have not differed withinthis same period in these remarks we have referred to special parts ororgans being still variable because they have recently varied and thuscome to differ but we have also seen in the second chapter that thesame principle applies to the whole individual for in a district wheremany species of any genus are found that is where there has been muchformer variation and differentiation or where the manufactory of newspecific forms has been actively at work there on an average we nowfind most varieties or incipient species secondary sexual charactersare highly variable and such characters differ much in the species ofthe same group variability in the same parts of the organisation hasgenerally been taken advantage of in giving secondary sexual differencesto the sexes of the same species and specific differences to theseveral species of the same genus any part or organ developed to anextraordinary size or in an extraordinary manner in comparison withthe same part or organ in the allied species must have gone through anextraordinary amount of modification since the genus arose and thus wecan understand why it should often still be variable in a much higherdegree than other parts for variation is a long continued and slowprocess and natural selection will in such cases not as yet have hadtime to overcome the tendency to further variability and toreversion to a less modified state but when a species with anyextraordinarily developed organ has become the parent of many modifieddescendants which on my view must be a very slow process requiringa long lapse of time in this case natural selection may readilyhave succeeded in giving a fixed character to the organ in howeverextraordinary a manner it may be developed species inheriting nearlythe same constitution from a common parent and exposed to similarinfluences will naturally tend to present analogous variations andthese same species may occasionally revert to some of the characters oftheir ancient progenitors although new and important modifications maynot arise from reversion and analogous variation such modificationswill add to the beautiful and harmonious diversity of nature whatever the cause may be of each slight difference in the offspringfrom their parents and a cause for each must exist it is the steadyaccumulation through natural selection of such differences whenbeneficial to the individual that gives rise to all the more importantmodifications of structure by which the innumerable beings on the faceof this earth are enabled to struggle with each other and the bestadapted to survive difficulties on theory difficulties on the theory of descent with modification transitions absence or rarity of transitional varieties transitions in habits oflife diversified habits in the same species species with habits widelydifferent from those of their allies organs of extreme perfection means of transition cases of difficulty natura non facit saltum organs of small importance organs not in all cases absolutely perfect the law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence embraced bythe theory of natural selection long before having arrived at this part of my work a crowd ofdifficulties will have occurred to the reader some of them are so gravethat to this day i can never reflect on them without being staggered but to the best of my judgment the greater number are only apparent and those that are real are not i think fatal to my theory these difficulties and objections may be classed under the followingheads firstly why if species have descended from other species by insensiblyfine gradations do we not everywhere see innumerable transitionalforms why is not all nature in confusion instead of the species being as we see them well defined secondly is it possible that an animal having for instance the structure and habits of a bat could have been formed by themodification of some animal with wholly different habits can webelieve that natural selection could produce on the one hand organsof trifling importance such as the tail of a giraffe which serves as afly flapper and on the other hand organs of such wonderful structure as the eye of which we hardly as yet fully understand the inimitableperfection thirdly can instincts be acquired and modified through naturalselection what shall we say to so marvellous an instinct as that whichleads the bee to make cells which have practically anticipated thediscoveries of profound mathematicians fourthly how can we account for species when crossed being sterileand producing sterile offspring whereas when varieties are crossed their fertility is unimpaired the two first heads shall be here discussed instinct and hybridism inseparate chapters on the absence or rarity of transitional varieties as natural selection acts solely by the preservation of profitablemodifications each new form will tend in a fully stocked country totake the place of and finally to exterminate its own less improvedparent or other less favoured forms with which it comes intocompetition thus extinction and natural selection will as we haveseen go hand in hand hence if we look at each species as descendedfrom some other unknown form both the parent and all the transitionalvarieties will generally have been exterminated by the very process offormation and perfection of the new form but as by this theory innumerable transitional forms must have existed why do we not find them embedded in countless numbers in the crust ofthe earth it will be much more convenient to discuss this question inthe chapter on the imperfection of the geological record and i willhere only state that i believe the answer mainly lies in the recordbeing incomparably less perfect than is generally supposed theimperfection of the record being chiefly due to organic beings notinhabiting profound depths of the sea and to their remains beingembedded and preserved to a future age only in masses of sedimentsufficiently thick and extensive to withstand an enormous amount offuture degradation and such fossiliferous masses can be accumulatedonly where much sediment is deposited on the shallow bed of the sea whilst it slowly subsides these contingencies will concur only rarely and after enormously long intervals whilst the bed of the seais stationary or is rising or when very little sediment is beingdeposited there will be blanks in our geological history the crust ofthe earth is a vast museum but the natural collections have been madeonly at intervals of time immensely remote but it may be urged that when several closely allied species inhabitthe same territory we surely ought to find at the present time manytransitional forms let us take a simple case in travelling from northto south over a continent we generally meet at successive intervalswith closely allied or representative species evidently filling nearlythe same place in the natural economy of the land these representativespecies often meet and interlock and as the one becomes rarer andrarer the other becomes more and more frequent till the one replacesthe other but if we compare these species where they intermingle theyare generally as absolutely distinct from each other in every detail ofstructure as are specimens taken from the metropolis inhabited by each by my theory these allied species have descended from a common parent and during the process of modification each has become adapted tothe conditions of life of its own region and has supplanted andexterminated its original parent and all the transitional varietiesbetween its past and present states hence we ought not to expect atthe present time to meet with numerous transitional varieties in eachregion though they must have existed there and may be embeddedthere in a fossil condition but in the intermediate region havingintermediate conditions of life why do we not now find closely linkingintermediate varieties this difficulty for a long time quite confoundedme but i think it can be in large part explained in the first place we should be extremely cautious in inferring becausean area is now continuous that it has been continuous during a longperiod geology would lead us to believe that almost every continent hasbeen broken up into islands even during the later tertiary periods and in such islands distinct species might have been separately formedwithout the possibility of intermediate varieties existing in theintermediate zones by changes in the form of the land and of climate marine areas now continuous must often have existed within recent timesin a far less continuous and uniform condition than at present but iwill pass over this way of escaping from the difficulty for i believethat many perfectly defined species have been formed on strictlycontinuous areas though i do not doubt that the formerly brokencondition of areas now continuous has played an important part in theformation of new species more especially with freely crossing andwandering animals in looking at species as they are now distributed over a wide area we generally find them tolerably numerous over a large territory thenbecoming somewhat abruptly rarer and rarer on the confines and finallydisappearing hence the neutral territory between two representativespecies is generally narrow in comparison with the territory proper toeach we see the same fact in ascending mountains and sometimes itis quite remarkable how abruptly as alph de candolle has observed a common alpine species disappears the same fact has been noticed byforbes in sounding the depths of the sea with the dredge to those wholook at climate and the physical conditions of life as the all importantelements of distribution these facts ought to cause surprise asclimate and height or depth graduate away insensibly but when webear in mind that almost every species even in its metropolis wouldincrease immensely in numbers were it not for other competing species that nearly all either prey on or serve as prey for others in short that each organic being is either directly or indirectly related inthe most important manner to other organic beings we must see that therange of the inhabitants of any country by no means exclusively dependson insensibly changing physical conditions but in large part on thepresence of other species on which it depends or by which it isdestroyed or with which it comes into competition and as these speciesare already defined objects however they may have become so notblending one into another by insensible gradations the range of any onespecies depending as it does on the range of others will tend to besharply defined moreover each species on the confines of its range where it exists in lessened numbers will during fluctuations in thenumber of its enemies or of its prey or in the seasons be extremelyliable to utter extermination and thus its geographical range will cometo be still more sharply defined if i am right in believing that allied or representative species wheninhabiting a continuous area are generally so distributed that eachhas a wide range with a comparatively narrow neutral territory betweenthem in which they become rather suddenly rarer and rarer then asvarieties do not essentially differ from species the same rule willprobably apply to both and if we in imagination adapt a varying speciesto a very large area we shall have to adapt two varieties to twolarge areas and a third variety to a narrow intermediate zone theintermediate variety consequently will exist in lesser numbers frominhabiting a narrow and lesser area and practically as far as i canmake out this rule holds good with varieties in a state of nature ihave met with striking instances of the rule in the case of varietiesintermediate between well marked varieties in the genus balanus and itwould appear from information given me by mr watson dr asa gray andmr wollaston that generally when varieties intermediate between twoother forms occur they are much rarer numerically than the forms whichthey connect now if we may trust these facts and inferences andtherefore conclude that varieties linking two other varieties togetherhave generally existed in lesser numbers than the forms which theyconnect then i think we can understand why intermediate varietiesshould not endure for very long periods why as a general rule theyshould be exterminated and disappear sooner than the forms which theyoriginally linked together for any form existing in lesser numbers would as already remarked run a greater chance of being exterminated than one existing in largenumbers and in this particular case the intermediate form would beeminently liable to the inroads of closely allied forms existing on bothsides of it but a far more important consideration as i believe isthat during the process of further modification by which two varietiesare supposed on my theory to be converted and perfected into twodistinct species the two which exist in larger numbers from inhabitinglarger areas will have a great advantage over the intermediate variety which exists in smaller numbers in a narrow and intermediate zone for forms existing in larger numbers will always have a better chance within any given period of presenting further favourable variations fornatural selection to seize on than will the rarer forms which exist inlesser numbers hence the more common forms in the race for life willtend to beat and supplant the less common forms for these will bemore slowly modified and improved it is the same principle which asi believe accounts for the common species in each country as shownin the second chapter presenting on an average a greater number ofwell marked varieties than do the rarer species i may illustrate what imean by supposing three varieties of sheep to be kept one adapted to anextensive mountainous region a second to a comparatively narrow hillytract and a third to wide plains at the base and that the inhabitantsare all trying with equal steadiness and skill to improve their stocksby selection the chances in this case will be strongly in favour of thegreat holders on the mountains or on the plains improving their breedsmore quickly than the small holders on the intermediate narrow hillytract and consequently the improved mountain or plain breed will soontake the place of the less improved hill breed and thus the two breeds which originally existed in greater numbers will come into closecontact with each other without the interposition of the supplanted intermediate hill variety to sum up i believe that species come to be tolerably well definedobjects and do not at any one period present an inextricable chaos ofvarying and intermediate links firstly because new varieties arevery slowly formed for variation is a very slow process and naturalselection can do nothing until favourable variations chance to occur and until a place in the natural polity of the country can be betterfilled by some modification of some one or more of its inhabitants and such new places will depend on slow changes of climate or on theoccasional immigration of new inhabitants and probably in a stillmore important degree on some of the old inhabitants becoming slowlymodified with the new forms thus produced and the old ones acting andreacting on each other so that in any one region and at any one time we ought only to see a few species presenting slight modifications ofstructure in some degree permanent and this assuredly we do see secondly areas now continuous must often have existed within therecent period in isolated portions in which many forms more especiallyamongst the classes which unite for each birth and wander much may haveseparately been rendered sufficiently distinct to rank as representativespecies in this case intermediate varieties between the severalrepresentative species and their common parent must formerly haveexisted in each broken portion of the land but these links willhave been supplanted and exterminated during the process of naturalselection so that they will no longer exist in a living state thirdly when two or more varieties have been formed in differentportions of a strictly continuous area intermediate varieties will itis probable at first have been formed in the intermediate zones butthey will generally have had a short duration for these intermediatevarieties will from reasons already assigned namely from what we knowof the actual distribution of closely allied or representative species and likewise of acknowledged varieties exist in the intermediate zonesin lesser numbers than the varieties which they tend to connect fromthis cause alone the intermediate varieties will be liable to accidentalextermination and during the process of further modification throughnatural selection they will almost certainly be beaten and supplantedby the forms which they connect for these from existing in greaternumbers will in the aggregate present more variation and thus befurther improved through natural selection and gain further advantages lastly looking not to any one time but to all time if my theory betrue numberless intermediate varieties linking most closely all thespecies of the same group together must assuredly have existed but thevery process of natural selection constantly tends as has been so oftenremarked to exterminate the parent forms and the intermediate links consequently evidence of their former existence could be found onlyamongst fossil remains which are preserved as we shall in a futurechapter attempt to show in an extremely imperfect and intermittentrecord on the origin and transitions of organic beings with peculiar habits andstructure it has been asked by the opponents of such views as i hold how forinstance a land carnivorous animal could have been converted into onewith aquatic habits for how could the animal in its transitional statehave subsisted it would be easy to show that within the same groupcarnivorous animals exist having every intermediate grade betweentruly aquatic and strictly terrestrial habits and as each exists by astruggle for life it is clear that each is well adapted in its habitsto its place in nature look at the mustela vison of north america which has webbed feet and which resembles an otter in its fur shortlegs and form of tail during summer this animal dives for and preys onfish but during the long winter it leaves the frozen waters and preyslike other polecats on mice and land animals if a different case hadbeen taken and it had been asked how an insectivorous quadruped couldpossibly have been converted into a flying bat the question would havebeen far more difficult and i could have given no answer yet i thinksuch difficulties have very little weight here as on other occasions i lie under a heavy disadvantage for outof the many striking cases which i have collected i can give only oneor two instances of transitional habits and structures in closely alliedspecies of the same genus and of diversified habits either constantor occasional in the same species and it seems to me that nothing lessthan a long list of such cases is sufficient to lessen the difficulty inany particular case like that of the bat look at the family of squirrels here we have the finest gradation fromanimals with their tails only slightly flattened and from others assir j richardson has remarked with the posterior part of their bodiesrather wide and with the skin on their flanks rather full to theso called flying squirrels and flying squirrels have their limbs andeven the base of the tail united by a broad expanse of skin whichserves as a parachute and allows them to glide through the air toan astonishing distance from tree to tree we cannot doubt that eachstructure is of use to each kind of squirrel in its own country byenabling it to escape birds or beasts of prey or to collect food morequickly or as there is reason to believe by lessening the dangerfrom occasional falls but it does not follow from this fact that thestructure of each squirrel is the best that it is possible to conceiveunder all natural conditions let the climate and vegetation change let other competing rodents or new beasts of prey immigrate or old onesbecome modified and all analogy would lead us to believe that some atleast of the squirrels would decrease in numbers or become exterminated unless they also became modified and improved in structure in acorresponding manner therefore i can see no difficulty moreespecially under changing conditions of life in the continuedpreservation of individuals with fuller and fuller flank membranes each modification being useful each being propagated until by theaccumulated effects of this process of natural selection a perfectso called flying squirrel was produced now look at the galeopithecus or flying lemur which formerly wasfalsely ranked amongst bats it has an extremely wide flank membrane stretching from the corners of the jaw to the tail and including thelimbs and the elongated fingers the flank membrane is also furnishedwith an extensor muscle although no graduated links of structure fitted for gliding through the air now connect the galeopithecus withthe other lemuridae yet i can see no difficulty in supposing that suchlinks formerly existed and that each had been formed by the same stepsas in the case of the less perfectly gliding squirrels and that eachgrade of structure had been useful to its possessor nor can i seeany insuperable difficulty in further believing it possible that themembrane connected fingers and fore arm of the galeopithecus might begreatly lengthened by natural selection and this as far as the organsof flight are concerned would convert it into a bat in bats which havethe wing membrane extended from the top of the shoulder to thetail including the hind legs we perhaps see traces of an apparatusoriginally constructed for gliding through the air rather than forflight if about a dozen genera of birds had become extinct or were unknown whowould have ventured to have surmised that birds might have existedwhich used their wings solely as flappers like the logger headed duck micropterus of eyton as fins in the water and front legs on the land like the penguin as sails like the ostrich and functionally for nopurpose like the apteryx yet the structure of each of these birds isgood for it under the conditions of life to which it is exposed foreach has to live by a struggle but it is not necessarily the bestpossible under all possible conditions it must not be inferred fromthese remarks that any of the grades of wing structure here alluded to which perhaps may all have resulted from disuse indicate the naturalsteps by which birds have acquired their perfect power of flight butthey serve at least to show what diversified means of transition arepossible seeing that a few members of such water breathing classes as thecrustacea and mollusca are adapted to live on the land and seeing thatwe have flying birds and mammals flying insects of the most diversifiedtypes and formerly had flying reptiles it is conceivable thatflying fish which now glide far through the air slightly rising andturning by the aid of their fluttering fins might have been modifiedinto perfectly winged animals if this had been effected who wouldhave ever imagined that in an early transitional state they had beeninhabitants of the open ocean and had used their incipient organs offlight exclusively as far as we know to escape being devoured by otherfish when we see any structure highly perfected for any particular habit as the wings of a bird for flight we should bear in mind that animalsdisplaying early transitional grades of the structure will seldomcontinue to exist to the present day for they will have beensupplanted by the very process of perfection through natural selection furthermore we may conclude that transitional grades between structuresfitted for very different habits of life will rarely have been developedat an early period in great numbers and under many subordinate forms thus to return to our imaginary illustration of the flying fish itdoes not seem probable that fishes capable of true flight would havebeen developed under many subordinate forms for taking prey of manykinds in many ways on the land and in the water until their organs offlight had come to a high stage of perfection so as to have given thema decided advantage over other animals in the battle for life hence thechance of discovering species with transitional grades of structure ina fossil condition will always be less from their having existedin lesser numbers than in the case of species with fully developedstructures i will now give two or three instances of diversified and of changedhabits in the individuals of the same species when either case occurs it would be easy for natural selection to fit the animal by somemodification of its structure for its changed habits or exclusivelyfor one of its several different habits but it is difficult to tell and immaterial for us whether habits generally change first andstructure afterwards or whether slight modifications of structure leadto changed habits both probably often change almost simultaneously ofcases of changed habits it will suffice merely to allude to that of themany british insects which now feed on exotic plants or exclusively onartificial substances of diversified habits innumerable instancescould be given i have often watched a tyrant flycatcher saurophagussulphuratus in south america hovering over one spot and thenproceeding to another like a kestrel and at other times standingstationary on the margin of water and then dashing like a kingfisher ata fish in our own country the larger titmouse parus major may be seenclimbing branches almost like a creeper it often like a shrike killssmall birds by blows on the head and i have many times seen and heardit hammering the seeds of the yew on a branch and thus breaking themlike a nuthatch in north america the black bear was seen by hearneswimming for hours with widely open mouth thus catching like a whale insects in the water even in so extreme a case as this if the supplyof insects were constant and if better adapted competitors did notalready exist in the country i can see no difficulty in a race of bearsbeing rendered by natural selection more and more aquatic in theirstructure and habits with larger and larger mouths till a creature wasproduced as monstrous as a whale as we sometimes see individuals of a species following habits widelydifferent from those both of their own species and of the other speciesof the same genus we might expect on my theory that such individualswould occasionally have given rise to new species having anomaloushabits and with their structure either slightly or considerablymodified from that of their proper type and such instances do occur innature can a more striking instance of adaptation be given than that ofa woodpecker for climbing trees and for seizing insects in the chinks ofthe bark yet in north america there are woodpeckers which feed largelyon fruit and others with elongated wings which chase insects on thewing and on the plains of la plata where not a tree grows there is awoodpecker which in every essential part of its organisation even inits colouring in the harsh tone of its voice and undulatory flight told me plainly of its close blood relationship to our common species yet it is a woodpecker which never climbs a tree petrels are the most aerial and oceanic of birds yet in the quietsounds of tierra del fuego the puffinuria berardi in its generalhabits in its astonishing power of diving its manner of swimming andof flying when unwillingly it takes flight would be mistaken by any onefor an auk or grebe nevertheless it is essentially a petrel but withmany parts of its organisation profoundly modified on the other hand the acutest observer by examining the dead body of the water ouzel wouldnever have suspected its sub aquatic habits yet this anomalousmember of the strictly terrestrial thrush family wholly subsists bydiving grasping the stones with its feet and using its wings underwater he who believes that each being has been created as we now see it mustoccasionally have felt surprise when he has met with an animal havinghabits and structure not at all in agreement what can be plainer thanthat the webbed feet of ducks and geese are formed for swimming yetthere are upland geese with webbed feet which rarely or never go nearthe water and no one except audubon has seen the frigate bird whichhas all its four toes webbed alight on the surface of the sea on theother hand grebes and coots are eminently aquatic although their toesare only bordered by membrane what seems plainer than that the longtoes of grallatores are formed for walking over swamps and floatingplants yet the water hen is nearly as aquatic as the coot and thelandrail nearly as terrestrial as the quail or partridge in suchcases and many others could be given habits have changed without acorresponding change of structure the webbed feet of the upland goosemay be said to have become rudimentary in function though not instructure in the frigate bird the deeply scooped membrane between thetoes shows that structure has begun to change he who believes in separate and innumerable acts of creation will say that in these cases it has pleased the creator to cause a being of onetype to take the place of one of another type but this seems to meonly restating the fact in dignified language he who believes in thestruggle for existence and in the principle of natural selection willacknowledge that every organic being is constantly endeavouring toincrease in numbers and that if any one being vary ever so little either in habits or structure and thus gain an advantage over someother inhabitant of the country it will seize on the place of thatinhabitant however different it may be from its own place hence itwill cause him no surprise that there should be geese and frigate birdswith webbed feet either living on the dry land or most rarely alightingon the water that there should be long toed corncrakes living inmeadows instead of in swamps that there should be woodpeckers where nota tree grows that there should be diving thrushes and petrels with thehabits of auks organs of extreme perfection and complication to suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances foradjusting the focus to different distances for admitting differentamounts of light and for the correction of spherical and chromaticaberration could have been formed by natural selection seems i freelyconfess absurd in the highest possible degree yet reason tells me that if numerous gradations from a perfect and complex eye to one veryimperfect and simple each grade being useful to its possessor can beshown to exist if further the eye does vary ever so slightly andthe variations be inherited which is certainly the case and if anyvariation or modification in the organ be ever useful to an animal underchanging conditions of life then the difficulty of believing that aperfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection thoughinsuperable by our imagination can hardly be considered real how anerve comes to be sensitive to light hardly concerns us more than howlife itself first originated but i may remark that several facts makeme suspect that any sensitive nerve may be rendered sensitive to light and likewise to those coarser vibrations of the air which produce sound in looking for the gradations by which an organ in any species has beenperfected we ought to look exclusively to its lineal ancestors butthis is scarcely ever possible and we are forced in each case to lookto species of the same group that is to the collateral descendantsfrom the same original parent form in order to see what gradations arepossible and for the chance of some gradations having been transmittedfrom the earlier stages of descent in an unaltered or little alteredcondition amongst existing vertebrata we find but a small amount ofgradation in the structure of the eye and from fossil species we canlearn nothing on this head in this great class we should probablyhave to descend far beneath the lowest known fossiliferous stratum todiscover the earlier stages by which the eye has been perfected in the articulata we can commence a series with an optic nerve merelycoated with pigment and without any other mechanism and from thislow stage numerous gradations of structure branching off in twofundamentally different lines can be shown to exist until we reacha moderately high stage of perfection in certain crustaceans forinstance there is a double cornea the inner one divided intofacets within each of which there is a lens shaped swelling in othercrustaceans the transparent cones which are coated by pigment and whichproperly act only by excluding lateral pencils of light are convex attheir upper ends and must act by convergence and at their lower endsthere seems to be an imperfect vitreous substance with these facts here far too briefly and imperfectly given which show that there ismuch graduated diversity in the eyes of living crustaceans and bearingin mind how small the number of living animals is in proportion to thosewhich have become extinct i can see no very great difficulty not morethan in the case of many other structures in believing that naturalselection has converted the simple apparatus of an optic nerve merelycoated with pigment and invested by transparent membrane into anoptical instrument as perfect as is possessed by any member of the greatarticulate class he who will go thus far if he find on finishing this treatise thatlarge bodies of facts otherwise inexplicable can be explained by thetheory of descent ought not to hesitate to go further and to admitthat a structure even as perfect as the eye of an eagle might be formedby natural selection although in this case he does not know any of thetransitional grades his reason ought to conquer his imagination thoughi have felt the difficulty far too keenly to be surprised at any degreeof hesitation in extending the principle of natural selection to suchstartling lengths it is scarcely possible to avoid comparing the eye to a telescope we know that this instrument has been perfected by the long continuedefforts of the highest human intellects and we naturally infer that theeye has been formed by a somewhat analogous process but may not thisinference be presumptuous have we any right to assume that the creatorworks by intellectual powers like those of man if we must compare theeye to an optical instrument we ought in imagination to take a thicklayer of transparent tissue with a nerve sensitive to light beneath and then suppose every part of this layer to be continually changingslowly in density so as to separate into layers of different densitiesand thicknesses placed at different distances from each other andwith the surfaces of each layer slowly changing in form further wemust suppose that there is a power always intently watching each slightaccidental alteration in the transparent layers and carefully selectingeach alteration which under varied circumstances may in any way or inany degree tend to produce a distincter image we must suppose each newstate of the instrument to be multiplied by the million and each tobe preserved till a better be produced and then the old ones tobe destroyed in living bodies variation will cause the slightalterations generation will multiply them almost infinitely andnatural selection will pick out with unerring skill each improvement let this process go on for millions on millions of years and duringeach year on millions of individuals of many kinds and may we notbelieve that a living optical instrument might thus be formed assuperior to one of glass as the works of the creator are to those ofman if it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed whichcould not possibly have been formed by numerous successive slightmodifications my theory would absolutely break down but i can findout no such case no doubt many organs exist of which we do not knowthe transitional grades more especially if we look to much isolatedspecies round which according to my theory there has been muchextinction or again if we look to an organ common to all the membersof a large class for in this latter case the organ must have been firstformed at an extremely remote period since which all the many membersof the class have been developed and in order to discover the earlytransitional grades through which the organ has passed we should haveto look to very ancient ancestral forms long since become extinct we should be extremely cautious in concluding that an organ could nothave been formed by transitional gradations of some kind numerous casescould be given amongst the lower animals of the same organ performingat the same time wholly distinct functions thus the alimentary canalrespires digests and excretes in the larva of the dragon fly and inthe fish cobites in the hydra the animal may be turned inside out andthe exterior surface will then digest and the stomach respire in suchcases natural selection might easily specialise if any advantage werethus gained a part or organ which had performed two functions for onefunction alone and thus wholly change its nature by insensible steps two distinct organs sometimes perform simultaneously the same functionin the same individual to give one instance there are fish with gillsor branchiae that breathe the air dissolved in the water at the sametime that they breathe free air in their swimbladders this latter organhaving a ductus pneumaticus for its supply and being divided by highlyvascular partitions in these cases one of the two organs might withease be modified and perfected so as to perform all the work by itself being aided during the process of modification by the other organ and then this other organ might be modified for some other and quitedistinct purpose or be quite obliterated the illustration of the swimbladder in fishes is a good one becauseit shows us clearly the highly important fact that an organ originallyconstructed for one purpose namely flotation may be converted into onefor a wholly different purpose namely respiration the swimbladder has also been worked in as an accessory to the auditory organs of certainfish or for i do not know which view is now generally held a partof the auditory apparatus has been worked in as a complement to theswimbladder all physiologists admit that the swimbladder is homologous or ideally similar in position and structure with the lungs ofthe higher vertebrate animals hence there seems to me to be no greatdifficulty in believing that natural selection has actually converted aswimbladder into a lung or organ used exclusively for respiration i can indeed hardly doubt that all vertebrate animals having truelungs have descended by ordinary generation from an ancient prototype of which we know nothing furnished with a floating apparatus orswimbladder we can thus as i infer from professor owen s interestingdescription of these parts understand the strange fact that everyparticle of food and drink which we swallow has to pass over theorifice of the trachea with some risk of falling into the lungs notwithstanding the beautiful contrivance by which the glottisis closed in the higher vertebrata the branchiae have whollydisappeared the slits on the sides of the neck and the loop like courseof the arteries still marking in the embryo their former position butit is conceivable that the now utterly lost branchiae might havebeen gradually worked in by natural selection for some quite distinctpurpose in the same manner as on the view entertained by somenaturalists that the branchiae and dorsal scales of annelids arehomologous with the wings and wing covers of insects it is probablethat organs which at a very ancient period served for respiration havebeen actually converted into organs of flight in considering transitions of organs it is so important to bear in mindthe probability of conversion from one function to another that i willgive one more instance pedunculated cirripedes have two minute folds ofskin called by me the ovigerous frena which serve through the meansof a sticky secretion to retain the eggs until they are hatched withinthe sack these cirripedes have no branchiae the whole surface of thebody and sack including the small frena serving for respiration thebalanidae or sessile cirripedes on the other hand have no ovigerousfrena the eggs lying loose at the bottom of the sack in thewell enclosed shell but they have large folded branchiae now i thinkno one will dispute that the ovigerous frena in the one family arestrictly homologous with the branchiae of the other family indeed theygraduate into each other therefore i do not doubt that little folds ofskin which originally served as ovigerous frena but which likewise very slightly aided the act of respiration have been graduallyconverted by natural selection into branchiae simply through anincrease in their size and the obliteration of their adhesive glands if all pedunculated cirripedes had become extinct and they have alreadysuffered far more extinction than have sessile cirripedes who wouldever have imagined that the branchiae in this latter family hadoriginally existed as organs for preventing the ova from being washedout of the sack although we must be extremely cautious in concluding that any organcould not possibly have been produced by successive transitionalgradations yet undoubtedly grave cases of difficulty occur some ofwhich will be discussed in my future work one of the gravest is that of neuter insects which are often verydifferently constructed from either the males or fertile females butthis case will be treated of in the next chapter the electric organsof fishes offer another case of special difficulty it is impossible toconceive by what steps these wondrous organs have been produced but as owen and others have remarked their intimate structure closelyresembles that of common muscle and as it has lately been shown thatrays have an organ closely analogous to the electric apparatus and yetdo not as matteuchi asserts discharge any electricity we must ownthat we are far too ignorant to argue that no transition of any kind ispossible the electric organs offer another and even more serious difficulty forthey occur in only about a dozen fishes of which several are widelyremote in their affinities generally when the same organ appears inseveral members of the same class especially if in members having verydifferent habits of life we may attribute its presence to inheritancefrom a common ancestor and its absence in some of the members to itsloss through disuse or natural selection but if the electric organs hadbeen inherited from one ancient progenitor thus provided we might haveexpected that all electric fishes would have been specially related toeach other nor does geology at all lead to the belief that formerlymost fishes had electric organs which most of their modifieddescendants have lost the presence of luminous organs in a few insects belonging to different families and orders offers a parallel case ofdifficulty other cases could be given for instance in plants the verycurious contrivance of a mass of pollen grains borne on afoot stalk with a sticky gland at the end is the same in orchis andasclepias genera almost as remote as possible amongst floweringplants in all these cases of two very distinct species furnishedwith apparently the same anomalous organ it should be observed that although the general appearance and function of the organ may be thesame yet some fundamental difference can generally be detected iam inclined to believe that in nearly the same way as two men havesometimes independently hit on the very same invention so naturalselection working for the good of each being and taking advantage ofanalogous variations has sometimes modified in very nearly the samemanner two parts in two organic beings which owe but little of theirstructure in common to inheritance from the same ancestor although in many cases it is most difficult to conjecture by whattransitions an organ could have arrived at its present state yet considering that the proportion of living and known forms to the extinctand unknown is very small i have been astonished how rarely an organcan be named towards which no transitional grade is known to lead the truth of this remark is indeed shown by that old canon in naturalhistory of natura non facit saltum we meet with this admission in thewritings of almost every experienced naturalist or as milne edwardshas well expressed it nature is prodigal in variety but niggard ininnovation why on the theory of creation should this be so whyshould all the parts and organs of many independent beings eachsupposed to have been separately created for its proper place in nature be so invariably linked together by graduated steps why should notnature have taken a leap from structure to structure on the theory ofnatural selection we can clearly understand why she should not fornatural selection can act only by taking advantage of slight successivevariations she can never take a leap but must advance by the shortestand slowest steps organs of little apparent importance as natural selection acts by life and death by the preservation ofindividuals with any favourable variation and by the destruction ofthose with any unfavourable deviation of structure i have sometimesfelt much difficulty in understanding the origin of simple parts ofwhich the importance does not seem sufficient to cause the preservationof successively varying individuals i have sometimes felt as muchdifficulty though of a very different kind on this head as in thecase of an organ as perfect and complex as the eye in the first place we are much too ignorant in regard to the wholeeconomy of any one organic being to say what slight modifications wouldbe of importance or not in a former chapter i have given instances ofmost trifling characters such as the down on fruit and the colour ofthe flesh which from determining the attacks of insects or from beingcorrelated with constitutional differences might assuredly be acted onby natural selection the tail of the giraffe looks like an artificiallyconstructed fly flapper and it seems at first incredible that thiscould have been adapted for its present purpose by successive slightmodifications each better and better for so trifling an object asdriving away flies yet we should pause before being too positive evenin this case for we know that the distribution and existence of cattleand other animals in south america absolutely depends on their power ofresisting the attacks of insects so that individuals which could by anymeans defend themselves from these small enemies would be able to rangeinto new pastures and thus gain a great advantage it is not that thelarger quadrupeds are actually destroyed except in some rare cases bythe flies but they are incessantly harassed and their strength reduced so that they are more subject to disease or not so well enabled in acoming dearth to search for food or to escape from beasts of prey organs now of trifling importance have probably in some cases been ofhigh importance to an early progenitor and after having been slowlyperfected at a former period have been transmitted in nearly thesame state although now become of very slight use and any actuallyinjurious deviations in their structure will always have been checked bynatural selection seeing how important an organ of locomotion thetail is in most aquatic animals its general presence and use for manypurposes in so many land animals which in their lungs or modifiedswim bladders betray their aquatic origin may perhaps be thus accountedfor a well developed tail having been formed in an aquatic animal itmight subsequently come to be worked in for all sorts of purposes asa fly flapper an organ of prehension or as an aid in turning as withthe dog though the aid must be slight for the hare with hardly anytail can double quickly enough in the second place we may sometimes attribute importance to characterswhich are really of very little importance and which have originatedfrom quite secondary causes independently of natural selection weshould remember that climate food etc probably have some littledirect influence on the organisation that characters reappear fromthe law of reversion that correlation of growth will have had a mostimportant influence in modifying various structures and finally that sexual selection will often have largely modified the externalcharacters of animals having a will to give one male an advantagein fighting with another or in charming the females moreover when amodification of structure has primarily arisen from the above orother unknown causes it may at first have been of no advantage tothe species but may subsequently have been taken advantage of by thedescendants of the species under new conditions of life and with newlyacquired habits to give a few instances to illustrate these latter remarks if greenwoodpeckers alone had existed and we did not know that there were manyblack and pied kinds i dare say that we should have thought that thegreen colour was a beautiful adaptation to hide this tree frequentingbird from its enemies and consequently that it was a character ofimportance and might have been acquired through natural selection as itis i have no doubt that the colour is due to some quite distinct cause probably to sexual selection a trailing bamboo in the malay archipelagoclimbs the loftiest trees by the aid of exquisitely constructed hooksclustered around the ends of the branches and this contrivance nodoubt is of the highest service to the plant but as we see nearlysimilar hooks on many trees which are not climbers the hooks on thebamboo may have arisen from unknown laws of growth and have beensubsequently taken advantage of by the plant undergoing furthermodification and becoming a climber the naked skin on the head of avulture is generally looked at as a direct adaptation for wallowing inputridity and so it may be or it may possibly be due to the directaction of putrid matter but we should be very cautious in drawingany such inference when we see that the skin on the head of theclean feeding male turkey is likewise naked the sutures in the skullsof young mammals have been advanced as a beautiful adaptation for aidingparturition and no doubt they facilitate or may be indispensablefor this act but as sutures occur in the skulls of young birds andreptiles which have only to escape from a broken egg we may infer thatthis structure has arisen from the laws of growth and has been takenadvantage of in the parturition of the higher animals we are profoundly ignorant of the causes producing slight andunimportant variations and we are immediately made conscious of this byreflecting on the differences in the breeds of our domesticated animalsin different countries more especially in the less civilized countrieswhere there has been but little artificial selection careful observersare convinced that a damp climate affects the growth of the hair andthat with the hair the horns are correlated mountain breeds alwaysdiffer from lowland breeds and a mountainous country would probablyaffect the hind limbs from exercising them more and possibly even theform of the pelvis and then by the law of homologous variation thefront limbs and even the head would probably be affected the shape also of the pelvis might affect by pressure the shape of the head ofthe young in the womb the laborious breathing necessary in high regionswould we have some reason to believe increase the size of the chest and again correlation would come into play animals kept by savages indifferent countries often have to struggle for their own subsistence and would be exposed to a certain extent to natural selection andindividuals with slightly different constitutions would succeedbest under different climates and there is reason to believe thatconstitution and colour are correlated a good observer also statesthat in cattle susceptibility to the attacks of flies is correlated withcolour as is the liability to be poisoned by certain plants so thatcolour would be thus subjected to the action of natural selection butwe are far too ignorant to speculate on the relative importance of theseveral known and unknown laws of variation and i have here alludedto them only to show that if we are unable to account for thecharacteristic differences of our domestic breeds which nevertheless wegenerally admit to have arisen through ordinary generation we oughtnot to lay too much stress on our ignorance of the precise cause of theslight analogous differences between species i might have adduced forthis same purpose the differences between the races of man which areso strongly marked i may add that some little light can apparentlybe thrown on the origin of these differences chiefly through sexualselection of a particular kind but without here entering on copiousdetails my reasoning would appear frivolous the foregoing remarks lead me to say a few words on the protest latelymade by some naturalists against the utilitarian doctrine that everydetail of structure has been produced for the good of its possessor they believe that very many structures have been created for beauty inthe eyes of man or for mere variety this doctrine if true would beabsolutely fatal to my theory yet i fully admit that many structuresare of no direct use to their possessors physical conditions probablyhave had some little effect on structure quite independently of anygood thus gained correlation of growth has no doubt played a mostimportant part and a useful modification of one part will often haveentailed on other parts diversified changes of no direct use so againcharacters which formerly were useful or which formerly had arisen fromcorrelation of growth or from other unknown cause may reappear fromthe law of reversion though now of no direct use the effects of sexualselection when displayed in beauty to charm the females can be calleduseful only in rather a forced sense but by far the most importantconsideration is that the chief part of the organisation of everybeing is simply due to inheritance and consequently though each beingassuredly is well fitted for its place in nature many structures nowhave no direct relation to the habits of life of each species thus wecan hardly believe that the webbed feet of the upland goose or of thefrigate bird are of special use to these birds we cannot believe thatthe same bones in the arm of the monkey in the fore leg of the horse in the wing of the bat and in the flipper of the seal are of specialuse to these animals we may safely attribute these structures toinheritance but to the progenitor of the upland goose and of thefrigate bird webbed feet no doubt were as useful as they now are to themost aquatic of existing birds so we may believe that the progenitor ofthe seal had not a flipper but a foot with five toes fitted for walkingor grasping and we may further venture to believe that the severalbones in the limbs of the monkey horse and bat which have beeninherited from a common progenitor were formerly of more special use tothat progenitor or its progenitors than they now are to these animalshaving such widely diversified habits therefore we may infer thatthese several bones might have been acquired through natural selection subjected formerly as now to the several laws of inheritance reversion correlation of growth etc hence every detail of structurein every living creature making some little allowance for the directaction of physical conditions may be viewed either as having been ofspecial use to some ancestral form or as being now of special use tothe descendants of this form either directly or indirectly through thecomplex laws of growth natural selection cannot possibly produce any modification in any onespecies exclusively for the good of another species though throughoutnature one species incessantly takes advantage of and profits by thestructure of another but natural selection can and does often producestructures for the direct injury of other species as we see in the fangof the adder and in the ovipositor of the ichneumon by which its eggsare deposited in the living bodies of other insects if it could beproved that any part of the structure of any one species had beenformed for the exclusive good of another species it would annihilate mytheory for such could not have been produced through natural selection although many statements may be found in works on natural history tothis effect i cannot find even one which seems to me of any weight itis admitted that the rattlesnake has a poison fang for its own defenceand for the destruction of its prey but some authors suppose that atthe same time this snake is furnished with a rattle for its own injury namely to warn its prey to escape i would almost as soon believe thatthe cat curls the end of its tail when preparing to spring in order towarn the doomed mouse but i have not space here to enter on this andother such cases natural selection will never produce in a being anything injurious toitself for natural selection acts solely by and for the good of each no organ will be formed as paley has remarked for the purpose ofcausing pain or for doing an injury to its possessor if a fair balancebe struck between the good and evil caused by each part each will befound on the whole advantageous after the lapse of time under changingconditions of life if any part comes to be injurious it will bemodified or if it be not so the being will become extinct as myriadshave become extinct natural selection tends only to make each organic being as perfect as or slightly more perfect than the other inhabitants of the same countrywith which it has to struggle for existence and we see that this is thedegree of perfection attained under nature the endemic productions ofnew zealand for instance are perfect one compared with another butthey are now rapidly yielding before the advancing legions of plantsand animals introduced from europe natural selection will not produceabsolute perfection nor do we always meet as far as we can judge withthis high standard under nature the correction for the aberration oflight is said on high authority not to be perfect even in that mostperfect organ the eye if our reason leads us to admire with enthusiasma multitude of inimitable contrivances in nature this same reason tellsus though we may easily err on both sides that some other contrivancesare less perfect can we consider the sting of the wasp or of the beeas perfect which when used against many attacking animals cannot bewithdrawn owing to the backward serratures and so inevitably causesthe death of the insect by tearing out its viscera if we look at the sting of the bee as having originally existed in aremote progenitor as a boring and serrated instrument like that in somany members of the same great order and which has been modifiedbut not perfected for its present purpose with the poison originallyadapted to cause galls subsequently intensified we can perhapsunderstand how it is that the use of the sting should so often cause theinsect s own death for if on the whole the power of stinging beuseful to the community it will fulfil all the requirements of naturalselection though it may cause the death of some few members if weadmire the truly wonderful power of scent by which the males of manyinsects find their females can we admire the production for thissingle purpose of thousands of drones which are utterly useless to thecommunity for any other end and which are ultimately slaughtered bytheir industrious and sterile sisters it may be difficult but we oughtto admire the savage instinctive hatred of the queen bee which urgesher instantly to destroy the young queens her daughters as soon as born or to perish herself in the combat for undoubtedly this is for thegood of the community and maternal love or maternal hatred thoughthe latter fortunately is most rare is all the same to the inexorableprinciple of natural selection if we admire the several ingeniouscontrivances by which the flowers of the orchis and of many otherplants are fertilised through insect agency can we consider as equallyperfect the elaboration by our fir trees of dense clouds of pollen inorder that a few granules may be wafted by a chance breeze on to theovules summary of chapter we have in this chapter discussed some of the difficulties andobjections which may be urged against my theory many of them are verygrave but i think that in the discussion light has been thrown onseveral facts which on the theory of independent acts of creation areutterly obscure we have seen that species at any one period are notindefinitely variable and are not linked together by a multitude ofintermediate gradations partly because the process of natural selectionwill always be very slow and will act at any one time only on a veryfew forms and partly because the very process of natural selectionalmost implies the continual supplanting and extinction of precedingand intermediate gradations closely allied species now living ona continuous area must often have been formed when the area was notcontinuous and when the conditions of life did not insensibly graduateaway from one part to another when two varieties are formed in twodistricts of a continuous area an intermediate variety will often beformed fitted for an intermediate zone but from reasons assigned theintermediate variety will usually exist in lesser numbers than the twoforms which it connects consequently the two latter during the courseof further modification from existing in greater numbers will have agreat advantage over the less numerous intermediate variety and willthus generally succeed in supplanting and exterminating it we have seen in this chapter how cautious we should be in concludingthat the most different habits of life could not graduate into eachother that a bat for instance could not have been formed by naturalselection from an animal which at first could only glide through theair we have seen that a species may under new conditions of life change itshabits or have diversified habits with some habits very unlike thoseof its nearest congeners hence we can understand bearing in mind thateach organic being is trying to live wherever it can live how it hasarisen that there are upland geese with webbed feet ground woodpeckers diving thrushes and petrels with the habits of auks although the belief that an organ so perfect as the eye could have beenformed by natural selection is more than enough to stagger any one yetin the case of any organ if we know of a long series of gradations incomplexity each good for its possessor then under changing conditionsof life there is no logical impossibility in the acquirement of anyconceivable degree of perfection through natural selection in the casesin which we know of no intermediate or transitional states we shouldbe very cautious in concluding that none could have existed for thehomologies of many organs and their intermediate states show thatwonderful metamorphoses in function are at least possible for instance a swim bladder has apparently been converted into an air breathing lung the same organ having performed simultaneously very different functions and then having been specialised for one function and two very distinctorgans having performed at the same time the same function the onehaving been perfected whilst aided by the other must often have largelyfacilitated transitions we are far too ignorant in almost every case to be enabled to assertthat any part or organ is so unimportant for the welfare of a species that modifications in its structure could not have been slowlyaccumulated by means of natural selection but we may confidentlybelieve that many modifications wholly due to the laws of growth andat first in no way advantageous to a species have been subsequentlytaken advantage of by the still further modified descendants of thisspecies we may also believe that a part formerly of high importancehas often been retained as the tail of an aquatic animal by itsterrestrial descendants though it has become of such small importancethat it could not in its present state have been acquired by naturalselection a power which acts solely by the preservation of profitablevariations in the struggle for life natural selection will produce nothing in one species for the exclusivegood or injury of another though it may well produce parts organs andexcretions highly useful or even indispensable or highly injurious toanother species but in all cases at the same time useful to the owner natural selection in each well stocked country must act chiefly throughthe competition of the inhabitants one with another and consequentlywill produce perfection or strength in the battle for life onlyaccording to the standard of that country hence the inhabitants of onecountry generally the smaller one will often yield as we see they doyield to the inhabitants of another and generally larger country forin the larger country there will have existed more individuals and morediversified forms and the competition will have been severer andthus the standard of perfection will have been rendered higher naturalselection will not necessarily produce absolute perfection nor as faras we can judge by our limited faculties can absolute perfection beeverywhere found on the theory of natural selection we can clearly understand the fullmeaning of that old canon in natural history natura non facit saltum this canon if we look only to the present inhabitants of the world isnot strictly correct but if we include all those of past times it mustby my theory be strictly true it is generally acknowledged that all organic beings have been formed ontwo great laws unity of type and the conditions of existence by unityof type is meant that fundamental agreement in structure which we seein organic beings of the same class and which is quite independent oftheir habits of life on my theory unity of type is explained by unityof descent the expression of conditions of existence so often insistedon by the illustrious cuvier is fully embraced by the principle ofnatural selection for natural selection acts by either now adapting thevarying parts of each being to its organic and inorganic conditions oflife or by having adapted them during long past periods of time theadaptations being aided in some cases by use and disuse being slightlyaffected by the direct action of the external conditions of life andbeing in all cases subjected to the several laws of growth hence infact the law of the conditions of existence is the higher law as itincludes through the inheritance of former adaptations that of unityof type instinct instincts comparable with habits but different in their origin instincts graduated aphides and ants instincts variable domesticinstincts their origin natural instincts of the cuckoo ostrich andparasitic bees slave making ants hive bee its cell making instinct difficulties on the theory of the natural selection of instincts neuteror sterile insects summary the subject of instinct might have been worked into the previouschapters but i have thought that it would be more convenient to treatthe subject separately especially as so wonderful an instinct as thatof the hive bee making its cells will probably have occurred to manyreaders as a difficulty sufficient to overthrow my whole theory i mustpremise that i have nothing to do with the origin of the primary mentalpowers any more than i have with that of life itself we are concernedonly with the diversities of instinct and of the other mental qualitiesof animals within the same class i will not attempt any definition of instinct it would be easy to showthat several distinct mental actions are commonly embraced by this term but every one understands what is meant when it is said that instinctimpels the cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds nests an action which we ourselves should require experience to enable us toperform when performed by an animal more especially by a very youngone without any experience and when performed by many individuals inthe same way without their knowing for what purpose it is performed is usually said to be instinctive but i could show that none of thesecharacters of instinct are universal a little dose as pierre huberexpresses it of judgment or reason often comes into play even inanimals very low in the scale of nature frederick cuvier and several of the older metaphysicians have comparedinstinct with habit this comparison gives i think a remarkablyaccurate notion of the frame of mind under which an instinctive actionis performed but not of its origin how unconsciously many habitualactions are performed indeed not rarely in direct opposition to ourconscious will yet they may be modified by the will or reason habitseasily become associated with other habits and with certain periodsof time and states of the body when once acquired they often remainconstant throughout life several other points of resemblance betweeninstincts and habits could be pointed out as in repeating a well knownsong so in instincts one action follows another by a sort of rhythm if a person be interrupted in a song or in repeating anything by rote he is generally forced to go back to recover the habitual train ofthought so p huber found it was with a caterpillar which makes a verycomplicated hammock for if he took a caterpillar which had completedits hammock up to say the sixth stage of construction and put it intoa hammock completed up only to the third stage the caterpillar simplyre performed the fourth fifth and sixth stages of construction if however a caterpillar were taken out of a hammock made up forinstance to the third stage and were put into one finished up to thesixth stage so that much of its work was already done for it far fromfeeling the benefit of this it was much embarrassed and in order tocomplete its hammock seemed forced to start from the third stage whereit had left off and thus tried to complete the already finished work if we suppose any habitual action to become inherited and i thinkit can be shown that this does sometimes happen then the resemblancebetween what originally was a habit and an instinct becomes so close asnot to be distinguished if mozart instead of playing the pianoforte atthree years old with wonderfully little practice had played a tunewith no practice at all he might truly be said to have done soinstinctively but it would be the most serious error to suppose thatthe greater number of instincts have been acquired by habit inone generation and then transmitted by inheritance to succeedinggenerations it can be clearly shown that the most wonderful instinctswith which we are acquainted namely those of the hive bee and of manyants could not possibly have been thus acquired it will be universally admitted that instincts are as important ascorporeal structure for the welfare of each species under its presentconditions of life under changed conditions of life it is at leastpossible that slight modifications of instinct might be profitable to aspecies and if it can be shown that instincts do vary ever so little then i can see no difficulty in natural selection preserving andcontinually accumulating variations of instinct to any extent that maybe profitable it is thus as i believe that all the most complexand wonderful instincts have originated as modifications of corporealstructure arise from and are increased by use or habit and arediminished or lost by disuse so i do not doubt it has been withinstincts but i believe that the effects of habit are of quitesubordinate importance to the effects of the natural selection of whatmay be called accidental variations of instincts that is of variationsproduced by the same unknown causes which produce slight deviations ofbodily structure no complex instinct can possibly be produced through natural selection except by the slow and gradual accumulation of numerous slight yetprofitable variations hence as in the case of corporeal structures we ought to find in nature not the actual transitional gradations bywhich each complex instinct has been acquired for these could be foundonly in the lineal ancestors of each species but we ought to find inthe collateral lines of descent some evidence of such gradations orwe ought at least to be able to show that gradations of some kind arepossible and this we certainly can do i have been surprised to find making allowance for the instincts of animals having been but littleobserved except in europe and north america and for no instinct beingknown amongst extinct species how very generally gradations leading tothe most complex instincts can be discovered the canon of natura nonfacit saltum applies with almost equal force to instincts as to bodilyorgans changes of instinct may sometimes be facilitated by the samespecies having different instincts at different periods of life orat different seasons of the year or when placed under differentcircumstances etc in which case either one or the other instinctmight be preserved by natural selection and such instances of diversityof instinct in the same species can be shown to occur in nature again as in the case of corporeal structure and conformably with mytheory the instinct of each species is good for itself but has never as far as we can judge been produced for the exclusive good of others one of the strongest instances of an animal apparently performing anaction for the sole good of another with which i am acquainted is thatof aphides voluntarily yielding their sweet excretion to ants that theydo so voluntarily the following facts show i removed all the ants froma group of about a dozen aphides on a dock plant and prevented theirattendance during several hours after this interval i felt sure thatthe aphides would want to excrete i watched them for some time througha lens but not one excreted i then tickled and stroked them with ahair in the same manner as well as i could as the ants do with theirantennae but not one excreted afterwards i allowed an ant to visitthem and it immediately seemed by its eager way of running about tobe well aware what a rich flock it had discovered it then began to playwith its antennae on the abdomen first of one aphis and then of another and each aphis as soon as it felt the antennae immediately lifted upits abdomen and excreted a limpid drop of sweet juice which was eagerlydevoured by the ant even the quite young aphides behaved in thismanner showing that the action was instinctive and not the result ofexperience but as the excretion is extremely viscid it is probably aconvenience to the aphides to have it removed and therefore probablythe aphides do not instinctively excrete for the sole good of the ants although i do not believe that any animal in the world performs anaction for the exclusive good of another of a distinct species yeteach species tries to take advantage of the instincts of others as eachtakes advantage of the weaker bodily structure of others so again insome few cases certain instincts cannot be considered as absolutelyperfect but as details on this and other such points are notindispensable they may be here passed over as some degree of variation in instincts under a state of nature andthe inheritance of such variations are indispensable for the action ofnatural selection as many instances as possible ought to have been heregiven but want of space prevents me i can only assert that instinctscertainly do vary for instance the migratory instinct both in extentand direction and in its total loss so it is with the nests of birds which vary partly in dependence on the situations chosen and on thenature and temperature of the country inhabited but often from causeswholly unknown to us audubon has given several remarkable cases ofdifferences in nests of the same species in the northern and southernunited states fear of any particular enemy is certainly an instinctivequality as may be seen in nestling birds though it is strengthened byexperience and by the sight of fear of the same enemy in other animals but fear of man is slowly acquired as i have elsewhere shown byvarious animals inhabiting desert islands and we may see an instanceof this even in england in the greater wildness of all our large birdsthan of our small birds for the large birds have been most persecutedby man we may safely attribute the greater wildness of our large birdsto this cause for in uninhabited islands large birds are not morefearful than small and the magpie so wary in england is tame innorway as is the hooded crow in egypt that the general disposition of individuals of the same species born ina state of nature is extremely diversified can be shown by a multitudeof facts several cases also could be given of occasional and strangehabits in certain species which might if advantageous to the species give rise through natural selection to quite new instincts but i amwell aware that these general statements without facts given in detail can produce but a feeble effect on the reader s mind i can only repeatmy assurance that i do not speak without good evidence the possibility or even probability of inherited variationsof instinct in a state of nature will be strengthened by brieflyconsidering a few cases under domestication we shall thus also beenabled to see the respective parts which habit and the selection ofso called accidental variations have played in modifying the mentalqualities of our domestic animals a number of curious and authenticinstances could be given of the inheritance of all shades of dispositionand tastes and likewise of the oddest tricks associated with certainframes of mind or periods of time but let us look to the familiar caseof the several breeds of dogs it cannot be doubted that young pointers i have myself seen a striking instance will sometimes point and evenback other dogs the very first time that they are taken out retrievingis certainly in some degree inherited by retrievers and a tendency torun round instead of at a flock of sheep by shepherd dogs i cannotsee that these actions performed without experience by the young and in nearly the same manner by each individual performed with eagerdelight by each breed and without the end being known for the youngpointer can no more know that he points to aid his master thanthe white butterfly knows why she lays her eggs on the leaf of thecabbage i cannot see that these actions differ essentially from trueinstincts if we were to see one kind of wolf when young and withoutany training as soon as it scented its prey stand motionless like astatue and then slowly crawl forward with a peculiar gait and anotherkind of wolf rushing round instead of at a herd of deer and drivingthem to a distant point we should assuredly call these actionsinstinctive domestic instincts as they may be called are certainlyfar less fixed or invariable than natural instincts but they have beenacted on by far less rigorous selection and have been transmitted foran incomparably shorter period under less fixed conditions of life how strongly these domestic instincts habits and dispositions areinherited and how curiously they become mingled is well shown whendifferent breeds of dogs are crossed thus it is known that a cross witha bull dog has affected for many generations the courage and obstinacyof greyhounds and a cross with a greyhound has given to a whole familyof shepherd dogs a tendency to hunt hares these domestic instincts when thus tested by crossing resemble natural instincts which in alike manner become curiously blended together and for a long periodexhibit traces of the instincts of either parent for example le roydescribes a dog whose great grandfather was a wolf and this dogshowed a trace of its wild parentage only in one way by not coming in astraight line to his master when called domestic instincts are sometimes spoken of as actions which have becomeinherited solely from long continued and compulsory habit but this i think is not true no one would ever have thought of teaching orprobably could have taught the tumbler pigeon to tumble an actionwhich as i have witnessed is performed by young birds that havenever seen a pigeon tumble we may believe that some one pigeon showeda slight tendency to this strange habit and that the long continuedselection of the best individuals in successive generations madetumblers what they now are and near glasgow there are house tumblers as i hear from mr brent which cannot fly eighteen inches high withoutgoing head over heels it may be doubted whether any one would havethought of training a dog to point had not some one dog naturally showna tendency in this line and this is known occasionally to happen as ionce saw in a pure terrier when the first tendency was once displayed methodical selection and the inherited effects of compulsory training ineach successive generation would soon complete the work and unconsciousselection is still at work as each man tries to procure withoutintending to improve the breed dogs which will stand and hunt best on the other hand habit alone in some cases has sufficed no animal ismore difficult to tame than the young of the wild rabbit scarcely anyanimal is tamer than the young of the tame rabbit but i do not supposethat domestic rabbits have ever been selected for tameness and ipresume that we must attribute the whole of the inherited change fromextreme wildness to extreme tameness simply to habit and long continuedclose confinement natural instincts are lost under domestication a remarkable instance ofthis is seen in those breeds of fowls which very rarely or never become broody that is never wish to sit on their eggs familiarity aloneprevents our seeing how universally and largely the minds of ourdomestic animals have been modified by domestication it is scarcelypossible to doubt that the love of man has become instinctive in thedog all wolves foxes jackals and species of the cat genus whenkept tame are most eager to attack poultry sheep and pigs and thistendency has been found incurable in dogs which have been brought homeas puppies from countries such as tierra del fuego and australia wherethe savages do not keep these domestic animals how rarely on the otherhand do our civilised dogs even when quite young require to be taughtnot to attack poultry sheep and pigs no doubt they occasionallydo make an attack and are then beaten and if not cured they aredestroyed so that habit with some degree of selection has probablyconcurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs on the other hand young chickens have lost wholly by habit that fear of the dog and catwhich no doubt was originally instinctive in them in the same way as itis so plainly instinctive in young pheasants though reared under a hen it is not that chickens have lost all fear but fear only of dogs andcats for if the hen gives the danger chuckle they will run moreespecially young turkeys from under her and conceal themselves inthe surrounding grass or thickets and this is evidently done for theinstinctive purpose of allowing as we see in wild ground birds theirmother to fly away but this instinct retained by our chickens hasbecome useless under domestication for the mother hen has almost lostby disuse the power of flight hence we may conclude that domestic instincts have been acquired andnatural instincts have been lost partly by habit and partly by manselecting and accumulating during successive generations peculiarmental habits and actions which at first appeared from what we must inour ignorance call an accident in some cases compulsory habit alonehas sufficed to produce such inherited mental changes in other casescompulsory habit has done nothing and all has been the result ofselection pursued both methodically and unconsciously but in mostcases probably habit and selection have acted together we shall perhaps best understand how instincts in a state of naturehave become modified by selection by considering a few cases i willselect only three out of the several which i shall have to discuss inmy future work namely the instinct which leads the cuckoo to lay hereggs in other birds nests the slave making instinct of certain ants and the comb making power of the hive bee these two latter instinctshave generally and most justly been ranked by naturalists as the mostwonderful of all known instincts it is now commonly admitted that the more immediate and final causeof the cuckoo s instinct is that she lays her eggs not daily but atintervals of two or three days so that if she were to make her ownnest and sit on her own eggs those first laid would have to be leftfor some time unincubated or there would be eggs and young birds ofdifferent ages in the same nest if this were the case the process oflaying and hatching might be inconveniently long more especially as shehas to migrate at a very early period and the first hatched young wouldprobably have to be fed by the male alone but the american cuckoo isin this predicament for she makes her own nest and has eggs and youngsuccessively hatched all at the same time it has been asserted thatthe american cuckoo occasionally lays her eggs in other birds nests but i hear on the high authority of dr brewer that this is a mistake nevertheless i could give several instances of various birds which havebeen known occasionally to lay their eggs in other birds nests now letus suppose that the ancient progenitor of our european cuckoo had thehabits of the american cuckoo but that occasionally she laid an egg inanother bird s nest if the old bird profited by this occasional habit or if the young were made more vigorous by advantage having been takenof the mistaken maternal instinct of another bird than by their ownmother s care encumbered as she can hardly fail to be by having eggsand young of different ages at the same time then the old birds or thefostered young would gain an advantage and analogy would lead meto believe that the young thus reared would be apt to follow byinheritance the occasional and aberrant habit of their mother and intheir turn would be apt to lay their eggs in other birds nests andthus be successful in rearing their young by a continued process ofthis nature i believe that the strange instinct of our cuckoo could be and has been generated i may add that according to dr gray andto some other observers the european cuckoo has not utterly lost allmaternal love and care for her own offspring the occasional habit of birds laying their eggs in other birds nests either of the same or of a distinct species is not very uncommon withthe gallinaceae and this perhaps explains the origin of a singularinstinct in the allied group of ostriches for several hen ostriches at least in the case of the american species unite and lay first afew eggs in one nest and then in another and these are hatched by themales this instinct may probably be accounted for by the fact of thehens laying a large number of eggs but as in the case of the cuckoo at intervals of two or three days this instinct however of theamerican ostrich has not as yet been perfected for a surprising numberof eggs lie strewed over the plains so that in one day s hunting ipicked up no less than twenty lost and wasted eggs many bees are parasitic and always lay their eggs in the nests of beesof other kinds this case is more remarkable than that of the cuckoo for these bees have not only their instincts but their structuremodified in accordance with their parasitic habits for they do notpossess the pollen collecting apparatus which would be necessary ifthey had to store food for their own young some species likewise ofsphegidae wasp like insects are parasitic on other species and m fabre has lately shown good reason for believing that although thetachytes nigra generally makes its own burrow and stores it withparalysed prey for its own larvae to feed on yet that when this insectfinds a burrow already made and stored by another sphex it takesadvantage of the prize and becomes for the occasion parasitic in thiscase as with the supposed case of the cuckoo i can see no difficultyin natural selection making an occasional habit permanent if ofadvantage to the species and if the insect whose nest and stored foodare thus feloniously appropriated be not thus exterminated slave making instinct this remarkable instinct was first discovered in the formica polyerges rufescens by pierre huber a better observer even than his celebratedfather this ant is absolutely dependent on its slaves without theiraid the species would certainly become extinct in a single year themales and fertile females do no work the workers or sterile females though most energetic and courageous in capturing slaves do no otherwork they are incapable of making their own nests or of feeding theirown larvae when the old nest is found inconvenient and they have tomigrate it is the slaves which determine the migration and actuallycarry their masters in their jaws so utterly helpless are the masters that when huber shut up thirty of them without a slave but with plentyof the food which they like best and with their larvae and pupae tostimulate them to work they did nothing they could not even feedthemselves and many perished of hunger huber then introduced a singleslave f fusca and she instantly set to work fed and saved thesurvivors made some cells and tended the larvae and put all to rights what can be more extraordinary than these well ascertained facts if wehad not known of any other slave making ant it would have beenhopeless to have speculated how so wonderful an instinct could have beenperfected formica sanguinea was likewise first discovered by p huber to bea slave making ant this species is found in the southern parts ofengland and its habits have been attended to by mr f smith of thebritish museum to whom i am much indebted for information on this andother subjects although fully trusting to the statements of huber andmr smith i tried to approach the subject in a sceptical frame ofmind as any one may well be excused for doubting the truth of soextraordinary and odious an instinct as that of making slaves hencei will give the observations which i have myself made in some littledetail i opened fourteen nests of f sanguinea and found a few slavesin all males and fertile females of the slave species are found only intheir own proper communities and have never been observed in the nestsof f sanguinea the slaves are black and not above half the size oftheir red masters so that the contrast in their appearance is verygreat when the nest is slightly disturbed the slaves occasionally comeout and like their masters are much agitated and defend the nest whenthe nest is much disturbed and the larvae and pupae are exposed theslaves work energetically with their masters in carrying them away to aplace of safety hence it is clear that the slaves feel quite at home during the months of june and july on three successive years i havewatched for many hours several nests in surrey and sussex and neversaw a slave either leave or enter a nest as during these months the slaves are very few in number i thought that they might behavedifferently when more numerous but mr smith informs me that he haswatched the nests at various hours during may june and august both insurrey and hampshire and has never seen the slaves though presentin large numbers in august either leave or enter the nest hence heconsiders them as strictly household slaves the masters on the otherhand may be constantly seen bringing in materials for the nest andfood of all kinds during the present year however in the month ofjuly i came across a community with an unusually large stock of slaves and i observed a few slaves mingled with their masters leaving the nest and marching along the same road to a tall scotch fir tree twenty fiveyards distant which they ascended together probably in search ofaphides or cocci according to huber who had ample opportunitiesfor observation in switzerland the slaves habitually work with theirmasters in making the nest and they alone open and close the doors inthe morning and evening and as huber expressly states their principaloffice is to search for aphides this difference in the usual habits ofthe masters and slaves in the two countries probably depends merelyon the slaves being captured in greater numbers in switzerland than inengland one day i fortunately chanced to witness a migration from one nest toanother and it was a most interesting spectacle to behold the masterscarefully carrying as huber has described their slaves in their jaws another day my attention was struck by about a score of the slave makershaunting the same spot and evidently not in search of food theyapproached and were vigorously repulsed by an independent community ofthe slave species f fusca sometimes as many as three of theseants clinging to the legs of the slave making f sanguinea the latterruthlessly killed their small opponents and carried their deadbodies as food to their nest twenty nine yards distant but they wereprevented from getting any pupae to rear as slaves i then dug up asmall parcel of the pupae of f fusca from another nest and put themdown on a bare spot near the place of combat they were eagerly seized and carried off by the tyrants who perhaps fancied that after all they had been victorious in their late combat at the same time i laid on the same place a small parcel of the pupae ofanother species f flava with a few of these little yellow ants stillclinging to the fragments of the nest this species is sometimes thoughrarely made into slaves as has been described by mr smith although so small a species it is very courageous and i have seen itferociously attack other ants in one instance i found to my surprisean independent community of f flava under a stone beneath a nest of theslave making f sanguinea and when i had accidentally disturbed bothnests the little ants attacked their big neighbours with surprisingcourage now i was curious to ascertain whether f sanguinea coulddistinguish the pupae of f fusca which they habitually make intoslaves from those of the little and furious f flava which they rarelycapture and it was evident that they did at once distinguish them for we have seen that they eagerly and instantly seized the pupae of f fusca whereas they were much terrified when they came across the pupae or even the earth from the nest of f flava and quickly ran away butin about a quarter of an hour shortly after all the little yellow antshad crawled away they took heart and carried off the pupae one evening i visited another community of f sanguinea and found anumber of these ants entering their nest carrying the dead bodies of f fusca showing that it was not a migration and numerous pupae i tracedthe returning file burthened with booty for about forty yards toa very thick clump of heath whence i saw the last individual of f sanguinea emerge carrying a pupa but i was not able to find thedesolated nest in the thick heath the nest however must have beenclose at hand for two or three individuals of f fusca were rushingabout in the greatest agitation and one was perched motionless with itsown pupa in its mouth on the top of a spray of heath over its ravagedhome such are the facts though they did not need confirmation by me inregard to the wonderful instinct of making slaves let it be observedwhat a contrast the instinctive habits of f sanguinea present withthose of the f rufescens the latter does not build its own nest doesnot determine its own migrations does not collect food for itself orits young and cannot even feed itself it is absolutely dependent onits numerous slaves formica sanguinea on the other hand possessesmuch fewer slaves and in the early part of the summer extremely few the masters determine when and where a new nest shall be formed andwhen they migrate the masters carry the slaves both in switzerland andengland the slaves seem to have the exclusive care of the larvae andthe masters alone go on slave making expeditions in switzerland theslaves and masters work together making and bringing materials for thenest both but chiefly the slaves tend and milk as it may be called their aphides and thus both collect food for the community in englandthe masters alone usually leave the nest to collect building materialsand food for themselves their slaves and larvae so that the masters inthis country receive much less service from their slaves than they do inswitzerland by what steps the instinct of f sanguinea originated i will not pretendto conjecture but as ants which are not slave makers will as i haveseen carry off pupae of other species if scattered near their nests it is possible that pupae originally stored as food might becomedeveloped and the ants thus unintentionally reared would then followtheir proper instincts and do what work they could if their presenceproved useful to the species which had seized them if it were moreadvantageous to this species to capture workers than to procreatethem the habit of collecting pupae originally for food might by naturalselection be strengthened and rendered permanent for the very differentpurpose of raising slaves when the instinct was once acquired ifcarried out to a much less extent even than in our british f sanguinea which as we have seen is less aided by its slaves than the samespecies in switzerland i can see no difficulty in natural selectionincreasing and modifying the instinct always supposing eachmodification to be of use to the species until an ant was formed asabjectly dependent on its slaves as is the formica rufescens cell making instinct of the hive bee i will not here enter on minute details on this subject but will merelygive an outline of the conclusions at which i have arrived he must bea dull man who can examine the exquisite structure of a comb sobeautifully adapted to its end without enthusiastic admiration wehear from mathematicians that bees have practically solved a reconditeproblem and have made their cells of the proper shape to hold thegreatest possible amount of honey with the least possible consumptionof precious wax in their construction it has been remarked that askilful workman with fitting tools and measures would find itvery difficult to make cells of wax of the true form though this isperfectly effected by a crowd of bees working in a dark hive grantwhatever instincts you please and it seems at first quite inconceivablehow they can make all the necessary angles and planes or even perceivewhen they are correctly made but the difficulty is not nearly so greatas it at first appears all this beautiful work can be shown i think to follow from a few very simple instincts i was led to investigate this subject by mr waterhouse who has shownthat the form of the cell stands in close relation to the presence ofadjoining cells and the following view may perhaps be considered onlyas a modification of his theory let us look to the great principle ofgradation and see whether nature does not reveal to us her method ofwork at one end of a short series we have humble bees which use theirold cocoons to hold honey sometimes adding to them short tubes of wax and likewise making separate and very irregular rounded cells of wax atthe other end of the series we have the cells of the hive bee placed ina double layer each cell as is well known is an hexagonal prism withthe basal edges of its six sides bevelled so as to join on to a pyramid formed of three rhombs these rhombs have certain angles and the threewhich form the pyramidal base of a single cell on one side of the comb enter into the composition of the bases of three adjoining cells on theopposite side in the series between the extreme perfection of the cellsof the hive bee and the simplicity of those of the humble bee we havethe cells of the mexican melipona domestica carefully describedand figured by pierre huber the melipona itself is intermediate instructure between the hive and humble bee but more nearly related tothe latter it forms a nearly regular waxen comb of cylindrical cells in which the young are hatched and in addition some large cells ofwax for holding honey these latter cells are nearly spherical and ofnearly equal sizes and are aggregated into an irregular mass but theimportant point to notice is that these cells are always made at thatdegree of nearness to each other that they would have intersected orbroken into each other if the spheres had been completed but this isnever permitted the bees building perfectly flat walls of wax betweenthe spheres which thus tend to intersect hence each cell consists ofan outer spherical portion and of two three or more perfectly flatsurfaces according as the cell adjoins two three or more other cells when one cell comes into contact with three other cells which fromthe spheres being nearly of the same size is very frequently andnecessarily the case the three flat surfaces are united into a pyramid and this pyramid as huber has remarked is manifestly a gross imitationof the three sided pyramidal basis of the cell of the hive bee as inthe cells of the hive bee so here the three plane surfaces in any onecell necessarily enter into the construction of three adjoining cells it is obvious that the melipona saves wax by this manner of building for the flat walls between the adjoining cells are not double but areof the same thickness as the outer spherical portions and yet each flatportion forms a part of two cells reflecting on this case it occurred to me that if the melipona had madeits spheres at some given distance from each other and had made them ofequal sizes and had arranged them symmetrically in a double layer theresulting structure would probably have been as perfect as the comb ofthe hive bee accordingly i wrote to professor miller of cambridge and this geometer has kindly read over the following statement drawn upfrom his information and tells me that it is strictly correct if a number of equal spheres be described with their centres placed intwo parallel layers with the centre of each sphere at the distance ofradius x the square root of or radius x or at some lesserdistance from the centres of the six surrounding spheres in thesame layer and at the same distance from the centres of the adjoiningspheres in the other and parallel layer then if planes of intersectionbetween the several spheres in both layers be formed there will resulta double layer of hexagonal prisms united together by pyramidal basesformed of three rhombs and the rhombs and the sides of the hexagonalprisms will have every angle identically the same with the bestmeasurements which have been made of the cells of the hive bee hence we may safely conclude that if we could slightly modify theinstincts already possessed by the melipona and in themselves not verywonderful this bee would make a structure as wonderfully perfect asthat of the hive bee we must suppose the melipona to make her cellstruly spherical and of equal sizes and this would not be verysurprising seeing that she already does so to a certain extent andseeing what perfectly cylindrical burrows in wood many insects canmake apparently by turning round on a fixed point we must suppose themelipona to arrange her cells in level layers as she already does hercylindrical cells and we must further suppose and this is the greatestdifficulty that she can somehow judge accurately at what distance tostand from her fellow labourers when several are making their spheres but she is already so far enabled to judge of distance that she alwaysdescribes her spheres so as to intersect largely and then she unitesthe points of intersection by perfectly flat surfaces we have furtherto suppose but this is no difficulty that after hexagonal prisms havebeen formed by the intersection of adjoining spheres in the same layer she can prolong the hexagon to any length requisite to hold the stock ofhoney in the same way as the rude humble bee adds cylinders of waxto the circular mouths of her old cocoons by such modifications ofinstincts in themselves not very wonderful hardly more wonderful thanthose which guide a bird to make its nest i believe that the hive beehas acquired through natural selection her inimitable architecturalpowers but this theory can be tested by experiment following the example ofmr tegetmeier i separated two combs and put between them a long thick square strip of wax the bees instantly began to excavate minutecircular pits in it and as they deepened these little pits they madethem wider and wider until they were converted into shallow basins appearing to the eye perfectly true or parts of a sphere and of aboutthe diameter of a cell it was most interesting to me to observe thatwherever several bees had begun to excavate these basins near together they had begun their work at such a distance from each other that bythe time the basins had acquired the above stated width i e about thewidth of an ordinary cell and were in depth about one sixth of thediameter of the sphere of which they formed a part the rims of thebasins intersected or broke into each other as soon as this occurred the bees ceased to excavate and began to build up flat walls of waxon the lines of intersection between the basins so that each hexagonalprism was built upon the festooned edge of a smooth basin instead of onthe straight edges of a three sided pyramid as in the case of ordinarycells i then put into the hive instead of a thick square piece of wax athin and narrow knife edged ridge coloured with vermilion the beesinstantly began on both sides to excavate little basins near to eachother in the same way as before but the ridge of wax was so thin thatthe bottoms of the basins if they had been excavated to the same depthas in the former experiment would have broken into each other from theopposite sides the bees however did not suffer this to happen andthey stopped their excavations in due time so that the basins as soonas they had been a little deepened came to have flat bottoms and theseflat bottoms formed by thin little plates of the vermilion wax havingbeen left ungnawed were situated as far as the eye could judge exactly along the planes of imaginary intersection between the basins onthe opposite sides of the ridge of wax in parts only little bits inother parts large portions of a rhombic plate had been left between theopposed basins but the work from the unnatural state of things hadnot been neatly performed the bees must have worked at very nearly thesame rate on the opposite sides of the ridge of vermilion wax as theycircularly gnawed away and deepened the basins on both sides in orderto have succeeded in thus leaving flat plates between the basins bystopping work along the intermediate planes or planes of intersection considering how flexible thin wax is i do not see that there is anydifficulty in the bees whilst at work on the two sides of a stripof wax perceiving when they have gnawed the wax away to the properthinness and then stopping their work in ordinary combs it hasappeared to me that the bees do not always succeed in working at exactlythe same rate from the opposite sides for i have noticed half completedrhombs at the base of a just commenced cell which were slightly concaveon one side where i suppose that the bees had excavated too quickly and convex on the opposed side where the bees had worked less quickly in one well marked instance i put the comb back into the hive andallowed the bees to go on working for a short time and again examinedthe cell and i found that the rhombic plate had been completed and hadbecome perfectly flat it was absolutely impossible from the extremethinness of the little rhombic plate that they could have effected thisby gnawing away the convex side and i suspect that the bees in suchcases stand in the opposed cells and push and bend the ductile and warmwax which as i have tried is easily done into its proper intermediateplane and thus flatten it from the experiment of the ridge of vermilion wax we can clearly seethat if the bees were to build for themselves a thin wall of wax theycould make their cells of the proper shape by standing at the properdistance from each other by excavating at the same rate and byendeavouring to make equal spherical hollows but never allowing thespheres to break into each other now bees as may be clearly seen byexamining the edge of a growing comb do make a rough circumferentialwall or rim all round the comb and they gnaw into this from theopposite sides always working circularly as they deepen each cell theydo not make the whole three sided pyramidal base of any one cell at thesame time but only the one rhombic plate which stands on the extremegrowing margin or the two plates as the case may be and they nevercomplete the upper edges of the rhombic plates until the hexagonalwalls are commenced some of these statements differ from those made bythe justly celebrated elder huber but i am convinced of their accuracy and if i had space i could show that they are conformable with mytheory huber s statement that the very first cell is excavated out of a littleparallel sided wall of wax is not as far as i have seen strictlycorrect the first commencement having always been a little hood of wax but i will not here enter on these details we see how important a partexcavation plays in the construction of the cells but it would be agreat error to suppose that the bees cannot build up a rough wall of waxin the proper position that is along the plane of intersection betweentwo adjoining spheres i have several specimens showing clearly thatthey can do this even in the rude circumferential rim or wall of waxround a growing comb flexures may sometimes be observed correspondingin position to the planes of the rhombic basal plates of future cells but the rough wall of wax has in every case to be finished off by beinglargely gnawed away on both sides the manner in which the bees build iscurious they always make the first rough wall from ten to twenty timesthicker than the excessively thin finished wall of the cell which willultimately be left we shall understand how they work by supposingmasons first to pile up a broad ridge of cement and then to begincutting it away equally on both sides near the ground till a smooth very thin wall is left in the middle the masons always piling up thecut away cement and adding fresh cement on the summit of the ridge weshall thus have a thin wall steadily growing upward but always crownedby a gigantic coping from all the cells both those just commenced andthose completed being thus crowned by a strong coping of wax thebees can cluster and crawl over the comb without injuring the delicatehexagonal walls which are only about one four hundredth of an inch inthickness the plates of the pyramidal basis being about twice as thick by this singular manner of building strength is continually given tothe comb with the utmost ultimate economy of wax it seems at first to add to the difficulty of understanding how thecells are made that a multitude of bees all work together one beeafter working a short time at one cell going to another so that ashuber has stated a score of individuals work even at the commencementof the first cell i was able practically to show this fact by coveringthe edges of the hexagonal walls of a single cell or the extreme marginof the circumferential rim of a growing comb with an extremely thinlayer of melted vermilion wax and i invariably found that the colourwas most delicately diffused by the bees as delicately as a paintercould have done with his brush by atoms of the coloured wax having beentaken from the spot on which it had been placed and worked into thegrowing edges of the cells all round the work of construction seemsto be a sort of balance struck between many bees all instinctivelystanding at the same relative distance from each other all trying tosweep equal spheres and then building up or leaving ungnawed theplanes of intersection between these spheres it was really curious tonote in cases of difficulty as when two pieces of comb met at an angle how often the bees would entirely pull down and rebuild in differentways the same cell sometimes recurring to a shape which they had atfirst rejected when bees have a place on which they can stand in their proper positionsfor working for instance on a slip of wood placed directly under themiddle of a comb growing downwards so that the comb has to be built overone face of the slip in this case the bees can lay the foundationsof one wall of a new hexagon in its strictly proper place projectingbeyond the other completed cells it suffices that the bees should beenabled to stand at their proper relative distances from each otherand from the walls of the last completed cells and then by strikingimaginary spheres they can build up a wall intermediate between twoadjoining spheres but as far as i have seen they never gnaw away andfinish off the angles of a cell till a large part both of that cell andof the adjoining cells has been built this capacity in bees of layingdown under certain circumstances a rough wall in its proper placebetween two just commenced cells is important as it bears on a fact which seems at first quite subversive of the foregoing theory namely that the cells on the extreme margin of wasp combs are sometimesstrictly hexagonal but i have not space here to enter on this subject nor does there seem to me any great difficulty in a single insect asin the case of a queen wasp making hexagonal cells if she workalternately on the inside and outside of two or three cells commenced atthe same time always standing at the proper relative distance fromthe parts of the cells just begun sweeping spheres or cylinders andbuilding up intermediate planes it is even conceivable that an insectmight by fixing on a point at which to commence a cell and then movingoutside first to one point and then to five other points at theproper relative distances from the central point and from each other strike the planes of intersection and so make an isolated hexagon buti am not aware that any such case has been observed nor would any goodbe derived from a single hexagon being built as in its constructionmore materials would be required than for a cylinder as natural selection acts only by the accumulation of slightmodifications of structure or instinct each profitable to theindividual under its conditions of life it may reasonably be asked howa long and graduated succession of modified architectural instincts all tending towards the present perfect plan of construction couldhave profited the progenitors of the hive bee i think the answer isnot difficult it is known that bees are often hard pressed to getsufficient nectar and i am informed by mr tegetmeier that it has beenexperimentally found that no less than from twelve to fifteen pounds ofdry sugar are consumed by a hive of bees for the secretion of each poundof wax so that a prodigious quantity of fluid nectar must be collectedand consumed by the bees in a hive for the secretion of the waxnecessary for the construction of their combs moreover many bees haveto remain idle for many days during the process of secretion a largestore of honey is indispensable to support a large stock of bees duringthe winter and the security of the hive is known mainly to depend on alarge number of bees being supported hence the saving of wax by largelysaving honey must be a most important element of success in any familyof bees of course the success of any species of bee may be dependenton the number of its parasites or other enemies or on quite distinctcauses and so be altogether independent of the quantity of honey whichthe bees could collect but let us suppose that this latter circumstancedetermined as it probably often does determine the numbers of ahumble bee which could exist in a country and let us further supposethat the community lived throughout the winter and consequentlyrequired a store of honey there can in this case be no doubt that itwould be an advantage to our humble bee if a slight modification ofher instinct led her to make her waxen cells near together so as tointersect a little for a wall in common even to two adjoining cells would save some little wax hence it would continually be more and moreadvantageous to our humble bee if she were to make her cells more andmore regular nearer together and aggregated into a mass like thecells of the melipona for in this case a large part of the boundingsurface of each cell would serve to bound other cells and much waxwould be saved again from the same cause it would be advantageous tothe melipona if she were to make her cells closer together and moreregular in every way than at present for then as we have seen thespherical surfaces would wholly disappear and would all be replaced byplane surfaces and the melipona would make a comb as perfect as that ofthe hive bee beyond this stage of perfection in architecture naturalselection could not lead for the comb of the hive bee as far as we cansee is absolutely perfect in economising wax thus as i believe the most wonderful of all known instincts thatof the hive bee can be explained by natural selection having takenadvantage of numerous successive slight modifications of simplerinstincts natural selection having by slow degrees more and moreperfectly led the bees to sweep equal spheres at a given distance fromeach other in a double layer and to build up and excavate the wax alongthe planes of intersection the bees of course no more knowing thatthey swept their spheres at one particular distance from each other than they know what are the several angles of the hexagonal prisms andof the basal rhombic plates the motive power of the process of naturalselection having been economy of wax that individual swarm which wastedleast honey in the secretion of wax having succeeded best and havingtransmitted by inheritance its newly acquired economical instinct to newswarms which in their turn will have had the best chance of succeedingin the struggle for existence no doubt many instincts of very difficult explanation could be opposedto the theory of natural selection cases in which we cannot seehow an instinct could possibly have originated cases in which nointermediate gradations are known to exist cases of instinct ofapparently such trifling importance that they could hardly have beenacted on by natural selection cases of instincts almost identically thesame in animals so remote in the scale of nature that we cannot accountfor their similarity by inheritance from a common parent and musttherefore believe that they have been acquired by independent acts ofnatural selection i will not here enter on these several cases butwill confine myself to one special difficulty which at first appearedto me insuperable and actually fatal to my whole theory i allude tothe neuters or sterile females in insect communities for these neutersoften differ widely in instinct and in structure from both the malesand fertile females and yet from being sterile they cannot propagatetheir kind the subject well deserves to be discussed at great length but i willhere take only a single case that of working or sterile ants how theworkers have been rendered sterile is a difficulty but not much greaterthan that of any other striking modification of structure for it canbe shown that some insects and other articulate animals in a state ofnature occasionally become sterile and if such insects had been social and it had been profitable to the community that a number should havebeen annually born capable of work but incapable of procreation ican see no very great difficulty in this being effected by naturalselection but i must pass over this preliminary difficulty the greatdifficulty lies in the working ants differing widely from both the malesand the fertile females in structure as in the shape of the thorax andin being destitute of wings and sometimes of eyes and in instinct asfar as instinct alone is concerned the prodigious difference in thisrespect between the workers and the perfect females would have beenfar better exemplified by the hive bee if a working ant or otherneuter insect had been an animal in the ordinary state i should haveunhesitatingly assumed that all its characters had been slowly acquiredthrough natural selection namely by an individual having been bornwith some slight profitable modification of structure this beinginherited by its offspring which again varied and were again selected and so onwards but with the working ant we have an insect differinggreatly from its parents yet absolutely sterile so that it could neverhave transmitted successively acquired modifications of structure orinstinct to its progeny it may well be asked how is it possible toreconcile this case with the theory of natural selection first let it be remembered that we have innumerable instances both inour domestic productions and in those in a state of nature of all sortsof differences of structure which have become correlated to certainages and to either sex we have differences correlated not only toone sex but to that short period alone when the reproductive system isactive as in the nuptial plumage of many birds and in the hooked jawsof the male salmon we have even slight differences in the horns ofdifferent breeds of cattle in relation to an artificially imperfectstate of the male sex for oxen of certain breeds have longer horns thanin other breeds in comparison with the horns of the bulls or cows ofthese same breeds hence i can see no real difficulty in any characterhaving become correlated with the sterile condition of certain membersof insect communities the difficulty lies in understanding how suchcorrelated modifications of structure could have been slowly accumulatedby natural selection this difficulty though appearing insuperable is lessened or as ibelieve disappears when it is remembered that selection may be appliedto the family as well as to the individual and may thus gain thedesired end thus a well flavoured vegetable is cooked and theindividual is destroyed but the horticulturist sows seeds of the samestock and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety breedersof cattle wish the flesh and fat to be well marbled together the animalhas been slaughtered but the breeder goes with confidence to the samefamily i have such faith in the powers of selection that i do notdoubt that a breed of cattle always yielding oxen with extraordinarilylong horns could be slowly formed by carefully watching whichindividual bulls and cows when matched produced oxen with the longesthorns and yet no one ox could ever have propagated its kind thusi believe it has been with social insects a slight modification ofstructure or instinct correlated with the sterile condition of certainmembers of the community has been advantageous to the community consequently the fertile males and females of the same communityflourished and transmitted to their fertile offspring a tendency toproduce sterile members having the same modification and i believethat this process has been repeated until that prodigious amount ofdifference between the fertile and sterile females of the same specieshas been produced which we see in many social insects but we have not as yet touched on the climax of the difficulty namely the fact that the neuters of several ants differ not only from thefertile females and males but from each other sometimes to an almostincredible degree and are thus divided into two or even three castes the castes moreover do not generally graduate into each other but areperfectly well defined being as distinct from each other as are anytwo species of the same genus or rather as any two genera of the samefamily thus in eciton there are working and soldier neuters with jawsand instincts extraordinarily different in cryptocerus the workers ofone caste alone carry a wonderful sort of shield on their heads the useof which is quite unknown in the mexican myrmecocystus the workers ofone caste never leave the nest they are fed by the workers of anothercaste and they have an enormously developed abdomen which secretes asort of honey supplying the place of that excreted by the aphides orthe domestic cattle as they may be called which our european ants guardor imprison it will indeed be thought that i have an overweening confidence in theprinciple of natural selection when i do not admit that such wonderfuland well established facts at once annihilate my theory in the simplercase of neuter insects all of one caste or of the same kind which havebeen rendered by natural selection as i believe to be quite possible different from the fertile males and females in this case we maysafely conclude from the analogy of ordinary variations that eachsuccessive slight profitable modification did not probably at firstappear in all the individual neuters in the same nest but in a fewalone and that by the long continued selection of the fertile parentswhich produced most neuters with the profitable modification all theneuters ultimately came to have the desired character on this view weought occasionally to find neuter insects of the same species in thesame nest presenting gradations of structure and this we do find even often considering how few neuter insects out of europe have beencarefully examined mr f smith has shown how surprisingly the neutersof several british ants differ from each other in size and sometimesin colour and that the extreme forms can sometimes be perfectly linkedtogether by individuals taken out of the same nest i have myselfcompared perfect gradations of this kind it often happens that thelarger or the smaller sized workers are the most numerous or that bothlarge and small are numerous with those of an intermediate size scantyin numbers formica flava has larger and smaller workers with some ofintermediate size and in this species as mr f smith has observed the larger workers have simple eyes ocelli which though small canbe plainly distinguished whereas the smaller workers have their ocellirudimentary having carefully dissected several specimens of theseworkers i can affirm that the eyes are far more rudimentary in thesmaller workers than can be accounted for merely by their proportionallylesser size and i fully believe though i dare not assert sopositively that the workers of intermediate size have their ocelli inan exactly intermediate condition so that we here have two bodies ofsterile workers in the same nest differing not only in size butin their organs of vision yet connected by some few members in anintermediate condition i may digress by adding that if the smallerworkers had been the most useful to the community and those males andfemales had been continually selected which produced more and moreof the smaller workers until all the workers had come to be in thiscondition we should then have had a species of ant with neuters verynearly in the same condition with those of myrmica for the workers ofmyrmica have not even rudiments of ocelli though the male and femaleants of this genus have well developed ocelli i may give one other case so confidently did i expect to findgradations in important points of structure between the different castesof neuters in the same species that i gladly availed myself of mr f smith s offer of numerous specimens from the same nest of the driverant anomma of west africa the reader will perhaps best appreciatethe amount of difference in these workers by my giving not the actualmeasurements but a strictly accurate illustration the difference wasthe same as if we were to see a set of workmen building a house of whommany were five feet four inches high and many sixteen feet high butwe must suppose that the larger workmen had heads four instead of threetimes as big as those of the smaller men and jaws nearly five timesas big the jaws moreover of the working ants of the several sizesdiffered wonderfully in shape and in the form and number of the teeth but the important fact for us is that though the workers can be groupedinto castes of different sizes yet they graduate insensibly into eachother as does the widely different structure of their jaws i speakconfidently on this latter point as mr lubbock made drawings forme with the camera lucida of the jaws which i had dissected from theworkers of the several sizes with these facts before me i believe that natural selection by actingon the fertile parents could form a species which should regularlyproduce neuters either all of large size with one form of jaw or allof small size with jaws having a widely different structure or lastly and this is our climax of difficulty one set of workers of one size andstructure and simultaneously another set of workers of a different sizeand structure a graduated series having been first formed as in thecase of the driver ant and then the extreme forms from being the mostuseful to the community having been produced in greater and greaternumbers through the natural selection of the parents which generatedthem until none with an intermediate structure were produced thus as i believe the wonderful fact of two distinctly defined castesof sterile workers existing in the same nest both widely different fromeach other and from their parents has originated we can see how usefultheir production may have been to a social community of insects on thesame principle that the division of labour is useful to civilised man as ants work by inherited instincts and by inherited tools or weapons and not by acquired knowledge and manufactured instruments a perfectdivision of labour could be effected with them only by the workers beingsterile for had they been fertile they would have intercrossed andtheir instincts and structure would have become blended and naturehas as i believe effected this admirable division of labour in thecommunities of ants by the means of natural selection but i am boundto confess that with all my faith in this principle i should neverhave anticipated that natural selection could have been efficient in sohigh a degree had not the case of these neuter insects convinced meof the fact i have therefore discussed this case at some littlebut wholly insufficient length in order to show the power of naturalselection and likewise because this is by far the most serious specialdifficulty which my theory has encountered the case also is veryinteresting as it proves that with animals as with plants any amountof modification in structure can be effected by the accumulation ofnumerous slight and as we must call them accidental variations whichare in any manner profitable without exercise or habit having come intoplay for no amount of exercise or habit or volition in the utterlysterile members of a community could possibly have affected thestructure or instincts of the fertile members which alone leavedescendants i am surprised that no one has advanced this demonstrativecase of neuter insects against the well known doctrine of lamarck summary i have endeavoured briefly in this chapter to show that the mentalqualities of our domestic animals vary and that the variations areinherited still more briefly i have attempted to show that instinctsvary slightly in a state of nature no one will dispute that instinctsare of the highest importance to each animal therefore i can see nodifficulty under changing conditions of life in natural selectionaccumulating slight modifications of instinct to any extent in anyuseful direction in some cases habit or use and disuse have probablycome into play i do not pretend that the facts given in this chapterstrengthen in any great degree my theory but none of the cases ofdifficulty to the best of my judgment annihilate it on the otherhand the fact that instincts are not always absolutely perfect andare liable to mistakes that no instinct has been produced for theexclusive good of other animals but that each animal takes advantage ofthe instincts of others that the canon in natural history of naturanon facit saltum is applicable to instincts as well as to corporealstructure and is plainly explicable on the foregoing views but isotherwise inexplicable all tend to corroborate the theory of naturalselection this theory is also strengthened by some few other facts in regardto instincts as by that common case of closely allied but certainlydistinct species when inhabiting distant parts of the world and livingunder considerably different conditions of life yet often retainingnearly the same instincts for instance we can understand on theprinciple of inheritance how it is that the thrush of south americalines its nest with mud in the same peculiar manner as does our britishthrush how it is that the male wrens troglodytes of north america build cock nests to roost in like the males of our distinctkitty wrens a habit wholly unlike that of any other known bird finally it may not be a logical deduction but to my imagination itis far more satisfactory to look at such instincts as the young cuckooejecting its foster brothers ants making slaves the larvae ofichneumonidae feeding within the live bodies of caterpillars not asspecially endowed or created instincts but as small consequences of onegeneral law leading to the advancement of all organic beings namely multiply vary let the strongest live and the weakest die hybridism distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids sterility various in degree not universal affected by closeinterbreeding removed by domestication laws governing the sterilityof hybrids sterility not a special endowment but incidental on otherdifferences causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life andcrossing fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongreloffspring not universal hybrids and mongrels compared independently oftheir fertility summary the view generally entertained by naturalists is that species whenintercrossed have been specially endowed with the quality of sterility in order to prevent the confusion of all organic forms this viewcertainly seems at first probable for species within the same countrycould hardly have kept distinct had they been capable of crossingfreely the importance of the fact that hybrids are very generallysterile has i think been much underrated by some late writers on thetheory of natural selection the case is especially important inasmuchas the sterility of hybrids could not possibly be of any advantageto them and therefore could not have been acquired by the continuedpreservation of successive profitable degrees of sterility i hope however to be able to show that sterility is not a specially acquiredor endowed quality but is incidental on other acquired differences in treating this subject two classes of facts to a large extentfundamentally different have generally been confounded together namely the sterility of two species when first crossed and thesterility of the hybrids produced from them pure species have of course their organs of reproduction in a perfectcondition yet when intercrossed they produce either few or nooffspring hybrids on the other hand have their reproductive organsfunctionally impotent as may be clearly seen in the state of the maleelement in both plants and animals though the organs themselves areperfect in structure as far as the microscope reveals in the firstcase the two sexual elements which go to form the embryo are perfect inthe second case they are either not at all developed or are imperfectlydeveloped this distinction is important when the cause of thesterility which is common to the two cases has to be considered thedistinction has probably been slurred over owing to the sterility inboth cases being looked on as a special endowment beyond the provinceof our reasoning powers the fertility of varieties that is of the forms known or believed tohave descended from common parents when intercrossed and likewisethe fertility of their mongrel offspring is on my theory of equalimportance with the sterility of species for it seems to make a broadand clear distinction between varieties and species first for the sterility of species when crossed and of their hybridoffspring it is impossible to study the several memoirs and works ofthose two conscientious and admirable observers kolreuter and gartner who almost devoted their lives to this subject without being deeplyimpressed with the high generality of some degree of sterility kolreuter makes the rule universal but then he cuts the knot for inten cases in which he found two forms considered by most authors asdistinct species quite fertile together he unhesitatingly ranks themas varieties gartner also makes the rule equally universal and hedisputes the entire fertility of kolreuter s ten cases but in these andin many other cases gartner is obliged carefully to count the seeds inorder to show that there is any degree of sterility he always comparesthe maximum number of seeds produced by two species when crossed and bytheir hybrid offspring with the average number produced by both pureparent species in a state of nature but a serious cause of error seemsto me to be here introduced a plant to be hybridised must be castrated and what is often more important must be secluded in order to preventpollen being brought to it by insects from other plants nearly all theplants experimentised on by gartner were potted and apparently werekept in a chamber in his house that these processes are often injuriousto the fertility of a plant cannot be doubted for gartner gives inhis table about a score of cases of plants which he castrated andartificially fertilised with their own pollen and excluding all casessuch as the leguminosae in which there is an acknowledged difficultyin the manipulation half of these twenty plants had their fertilityin some degree impaired moreover as gartner during several yearsrepeatedly crossed the primrose and cowslip which we have such goodreason to believe to be varieties and only once or twice succeeded ingetting fertile seed as he found the common red and blue pimpernels anagallis arvensis and coerulea which the best botanists rank asvarieties absolutely sterile together and as he came to the sameconclusion in several other analogous cases it seems to me that wemay well be permitted to doubt whether many other species are really sosterile when intercrossed as gartner believes it is certain on the one hand that the sterility of various specieswhen crossed is so different in degree and graduates away so insensibly and on the other hand that the fertility of pure species is so easilyaffected by various circumstances that for all practical purposes it ismost difficult to say where perfect fertility ends and sterility begins i think no better evidence of this can be required than that the twomost experienced observers who have ever lived namely kolreuter andgartner should have arrived at diametrically opposite conclusionsin regard to the very same species it is also most instructive tocompare but i have not space here to enter on details the evidenceadvanced by our best botanists on the question whether certain doubtfulforms should be ranked as species or varieties with the evidence fromfertility adduced by different hybridisers or by the same author from experiments made during different years it can thus be shown thatneither sterility nor fertility affords any clear distinction betweenspecies and varieties but that the evidence from this source graduatesaway and is doubtful in the same degree as is the evidence derived fromother constitutional and structural differences in regard to the sterility of hybrids in successive generations thoughgartner was enabled to rear some hybrids carefully guarding them from across with either pure parent for six or seven and in one case forten generations yet he asserts positively that their fertility neverincreased but generally greatly decreased i do not doubt that this isusually the case and that the fertility often suddenly decreases inthe first few generations nevertheless i believe that in all theseexperiments the fertility has been diminished by an independent cause namely from close interbreeding i have collected so large a body offacts showing that close interbreeding lessens fertility and onthe other hand that an occasional cross with a distinct individual orvariety increases fertility that i cannot doubt the correctness of thisalmost universal belief amongst breeders hybrids are seldom raised byexperimentalists in great numbers and as the parent species or otherallied hybrids generally grow in the same garden the visits of insectsmust be carefully prevented during the flowering season hence hybridswill generally be fertilised during each generation by their ownindividual pollen and i am convinced that this would be injuriousto their fertility already lessened by their hybrid origin i amstrengthened in this conviction by a remarkable statement repeatedlymade by gartner namely that if even the less fertile hybrids beartificially fertilised with hybrid pollen of the same kind theirfertility notwithstanding the frequent ill effects of manipulation sometimes decidedly increases and goes on increasing now inartificial fertilisation pollen is as often taken by chance as i knowfrom my own experience from the anthers of another flower as from theanthers of the flower itself which is to be fertilised so that a crossbetween two flowers though probably on the same plant would be thuseffected moreover whenever complicated experiments are in progress so careful an observer as gartner would have castrated his hybrids andthis would have insured in each generation a cross with the pollen froma distinct flower either from the same plant or from another plant ofthe same hybrid nature and thus the strange fact of the increaseof fertility in the successive generations of artificially fertilisedhybrids may i believe be accounted for by close interbreeding havingbeen avoided now let us turn to the results arrived at by the third most experiencedhybridiser namely the honourable and reverend w herbert he is asemphatic in his conclusion that some hybrids are perfectly fertile asfertile as the pure parent species as are kolreuter and gartner thatsome degree of sterility between distinct species is a universal lawof nature he experimentised on some of the very same species as didgartner the difference in their results may i think be in partaccounted for by herbert s great horticultural skill and by his havinghothouses at his command of his many important statements i will heregive only a single one as an example namely that every ovule in a podof crinum capense fertilised by c revolutum produced a plant which he says i never saw to occur in a case of its natural fecundation sothat we here have perfect or even more than commonly perfect fertilityin a first cross between two distinct species this case of the crinum leads me to refer to a most singular fact namely that there are individual plants as with certain species oflobelia and with all the species of the genus hippeastrum which canbe far more easily fertilised by the pollen of another and distinctspecies than by their own pollen for these plants have been found toyield seed to the pollen of a distinct species though quite sterilewith their own pollen notwithstanding that their own pollen was foundto be perfectly good for it fertilised distinct species so thatcertain individual plants and all the individuals of certain speciescan actually be hybridised much more readily than they can beself fertilised for instance a bulb of hippeastrum aulicum producedfour flowers three were fertilised by herbert with their own pollen and the fourth was subsequently fertilised by the pollen of a compoundhybrid descended from three other and distinct species the result wasthat the ovaries of the three first flowers soon ceased to grow andafter a few days perished entirely whereas the pod impregnated bythe pollen of the hybrid made vigorous growth and rapid progress tomaturity and bore good seed which vegetated freely in a letter tome in mr herbert told me that he had then tried the experimentduring five years and he continued to try it during several subsequentyears and always with the same result this result has also beenconfirmed by other observers in the case of hippeastrum with itssub genera and in the case of some other genera as lobelia passifloraand verbascum although the plants in these experiments appearedperfectly healthy and although both the ovules and pollen of the sameflower were perfectly good with respect to other species yet as theywere functionally imperfect in their mutual self action we must inferthat the plants were in an unnatural state nevertheless these factsshow on what slight and mysterious causes the lesser or greaterfertility of species when crossed in comparison with the same specieswhen self fertilised sometimes depends the practical experiments of horticulturists though not made withscientific precision deserve some notice it is notorious in howcomplicated a manner the species of pelargonium fuchsia calceolaria petunia rhododendron etc have been crossed yet many of thesehybrids seed freely for instance herbert asserts that a hybrid fromcalceolaria integrifolia and plantaginea species most widely dissimilarin general habit reproduced itself as perfectly as if it had been anatural species from the mountains of chile i have taken some painsto ascertain the degree of fertility of some of the complex crosses ofrhododendrons and i am assured that many of them are perfectly fertile mr c noble for instance informs me that he raises stocks forgrafting from a hybrid between rhododendron ponticum and catawbiense and that this hybrid seeds as freely as it is possible to imagine hadhybrids when fairly treated gone on decreasing in fertility in eachsuccessive generation as gartner believes to be the case the factwould have been notorious to nurserymen horticulturists raise largebeds of the same hybrids and such alone are fairly treated for byinsect agency the several individuals of the same hybrid variety areallowed to freely cross with each other and the injurious influenceof close interbreeding is thus prevented any one may readily convincehimself of the efficiency of insect agency by examining the flowers ofthe more sterile kinds of hybrid rhododendrons which produce no pollen for he will find on their stigmas plenty of pollen brought from otherflowers in regard to animals much fewer experiments have been carefully triedthan with plants if our systematic arrangements can be trusted thatis if the genera of animals are as distinct from each other as are thegenera of plants then we may infer that animals more widely separatedin the scale of nature can be more easily crossed than in the case ofplants but the hybrids themselves are i think more sterile i doubtwhether any case of a perfectly fertile hybrid animal can be consideredas thoroughly well authenticated it should however be borne inmind that owing to few animals breeding freely under confinement fewexperiments have been fairly tried for instance the canary bird hasbeen crossed with nine other finches but as not one of these ninespecies breeds freely in confinement we have no right to expect thatthe first crosses between them and the canary or that their hybrids should be perfectly fertile again with respect to the fertility insuccessive generations of the more fertile hybrid animals i hardly knowof an instance in which two families of the same hybrid have been raisedat the same time from different parents so as to avoid the ill effectsof close interbreeding on the contrary brothers and sisters haveusually been crossed in each successive generation in opposition to theconstantly repeated admonition of every breeder and in this case it isnot at all surprising that the inherent sterility in the hybrids shouldhave gone on increasing if we were to act thus and pair brothers andsisters in the case of any pure animal which from any cause had theleast tendency to sterility the breed would assuredly be lost in a veryfew generations although i do not know of any thoroughly well authenticated cases ofperfectly fertile hybrid animals i have some reason to believe thatthe hybrids from cervulus vaginalis and reevesii and from phasianuscolchicus with p torquatus and with p versicolor are perfectlyfertile the hybrids from the common and chinese geese a cygnoides species which are so different that they are generally ranked indistinct genera have often bred in this country with either pureparent and in one single instance they have bred inter se this waseffected by mr eyton who raised two hybrids from the same parents butfrom different hatches and from these two birds he raised no less thaneight hybrids grandchildren of the pure geese from one nest in india however these cross bred geese must be far more fertile for i amassured by two eminently capable judges namely mr blyth and capt hutton that whole flocks of these crossed geese are kept in variousparts of the country and as they are kept for profit where neitherpure parent species exists they must certainly be highly fertile a doctrine which originated with pallas has been largely acceptedby modern naturalists namely that most of our domestic animals havedescended from two or more aboriginal species since commingled byintercrossing on this view the aboriginal species must either at firsthave produced quite fertile hybrids or the hybrids must have become insubsequent generations quite fertile under domestication this latteralternative seems to me the most probable and i am inclined to believein its truth although it rests on no direct evidence i believe forinstance that our dogs have descended from several wild stocks yet with perhaps the exception of certain indigenous domestic dogs of southamerica all are quite fertile together and analogy makes me greatlydoubt whether the several aboriginal species would at first have freelybred together and have produced quite fertile hybrids so again thereis reason to believe that our european and the humped indian cattle arequite fertile together but from facts communicated to me by mr blyth i think they must be considered as distinct species on this view ofthe origin of many of our domestic animals we must either give up thebelief of the almost universal sterility of distinct species ofanimals when crossed or we must look at sterility not as an indeliblecharacteristic but as one capable of being removed by domestication finally looking to all the ascertained facts on the intercrossing ofplants and animals it may be concluded that some degree of sterility both in first crosses and in hybrids is an extremely general result but that it cannot under our present state of knowledge be consideredas absolutely universal laws governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids we will now consider a little more in detail the circumstances andrules governing the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids our chiefobject will be to see whether or not the rules indicate that specieshave specially been endowed with this quality in order to prevent theircrossing and blending together in utter confusion the following rulesand conclusions are chiefly drawn up from gartner s admirable work onthe hybridisation of plants i have taken much pains to ascertain howfar the rules apply to animals and considering how scanty our knowledgeis in regard to hybrid animals i have been surprised to find howgenerally the same rules apply to both kingdoms it has been already remarked that the degree of fertility both offirst crosses and of hybrids graduates from zero to perfect fertility it is surprising in how many curious ways this gradation can be shown toexist but only the barest outline of the facts can here be given whenpollen from a plant of one family is placed on the stigma of a plant ofa distinct family it exerts no more influence than so much inorganicdust from this absolute zero of fertility the pollen of differentspecies of the same genus applied to the stigma of some one species yields a perfect gradation in the number of seeds produced up to nearlycomplete or even quite complete fertility and as we have seen incertain abnormal cases even to an excess of fertility beyond thatwhich the plant s own pollen will produce so in hybrids themselves there are some which never have produced and probably never wouldproduce even with the pollen of either pure parent a single fertileseed but in some of these cases a first trace of fertility may bedetected by the pollen of one of the pure parent species causing theflower of the hybrid to wither earlier than it otherwise would havedone and the early withering of the flower is well known to be a signof incipient fertilisation from this extreme degree of sterility wehave self fertilised hybrids producing a greater and greater number ofseeds up to perfect fertility hybrids from two species which are very difficult to cross and whichrarely produce any offspring are generally very sterile but theparallelism between the difficulty of making a first cross and thesterility of the hybrids thus produced two classes of facts which aregenerally confounded together is by no means strict there are manycases in which two pure species can be united with unusual facility and produce numerous hybrid offspring yet these hybrids are remarkablysterile on the other hand there are species which can be crossedvery rarely or with extreme difficulty but the hybrids when at lastproduced are very fertile even within the limits of the same genus for instance in dianthus these two opposite cases occur the fertility both of first crosses and of hybrids is more easilyaffected by unfavourable conditions than is the fertility of purespecies but the degree of fertility is likewise innately variable forit is not always the same when the same two species are crossed underthe same circumstances but depends in part upon the constitution of theindividuals which happen to have been chosen for the experiment so itis with hybrids for their degree of fertility is often found to differgreatly in the several individuals raised from seed out of the samecapsule and exposed to exactly the same conditions by the term systematic affinity is meant the resemblance betweenspecies in structure and in constitution more especially in thestructure of parts which are of high physiological importance and whichdiffer little in the allied species now the fertility of first crossesbetween species and of the hybrids produced from them is largelygoverned by their systematic affinity this is clearly shown by hybridsnever having been raised between species ranked by systematists indistinct families and on the other hand by very closely alliedspecies generally uniting with facility but the correspondence betweensystematic affinity and the facility of crossing is by no means strict a multitude of cases could be given of very closely allied species whichwill not unite or only with extreme difficulty and on the other handof very distinct species which unite with the utmost facility inthe same family there may be a genus as dianthus in which very manyspecies can most readily be crossed and another genus as silene in which the most persevering efforts have failed to produce betweenextremely close species a single hybrid even within the limits of thesame genus we meet with this same difference for instance the manyspecies of nicotiana have been more largely crossed than the species ofalmost any other genus but gartner found that n acuminata which isnot a particularly distinct species obstinately failed to fertilise orto be fertilised by no less than eight other species of nicotiana verymany analogous facts could be given no one has been able to point out what kind or what amount ofdifference in any recognisable character is sufficient to prevent twospecies crossing it can be shown that plants most widely different inhabit and general appearance and having strongly marked differences inevery part of the flower even in the pollen in the fruit and in thecotyledons can be crossed annual and perennial plants deciduous andevergreen trees plants inhabiting different stations and fitted forextremely different climates can often be crossed with ease by a reciprocal cross between two species i mean the case forinstance of a stallion horse being first crossed with a female ass andthen a male ass with a mare these two species may then be said to havebeen reciprocally crossed there is often the widest possible differencein the facility of making reciprocal crosses such cases are highlyimportant for they prove that the capacity in any two species to crossis often completely independent of their systematic affinity or of anyrecognisable difference in their whole organisation on the other hand these cases clearly show that the capacity for crossing is connectedwith constitutional differences imperceptible by us and confined to thereproductive system this difference in the result of reciprocal crossesbetween the same two species was long ago observed by kolreuter to givean instance mirabilis jalappa can easily be fertilised by the pollen ofm longiflora and the hybrids thus produced are sufficiently fertile but kolreuter tried more than two hundred times during eight followingyears to fertilise reciprocally m longiflora with the pollen of m jalappa and utterly failed several other equally striking cases couldbe given thuret has observed the same fact with certain sea weedsor fuci gartner moreover found that this difference of facility inmaking reciprocal crosses is extremely common in a lesser degree he hasobserved it even between forms so closely related as matthiola annuaand glabra that many botanists rank them only as varieties it is alsoa remarkable fact that hybrids raised from reciprocal crosses thoughof course compounded of the very same two species the one specieshaving first been used as the father and then as the mother generallydiffer in fertility in a small and occasionally in a high degree several other singular rules could be given from gartner for instance some species have a remarkable power of crossing with other species other species of the same genus have a remarkable power of impressingtheir likeness on their hybrid offspring but these two powers do not atall necessarily go together there are certain hybrids which insteadof having as is usual an intermediate character between their twoparents always closely resemble one of them and such hybrids thoughexternally so like one of their pure parent species are with rareexceptions extremely sterile so again amongst hybrids which areusually intermediate in structure between their parents exceptional andabnormal individuals sometimes are born which closely resemble one oftheir pure parents and these hybrids are almost always utterly sterile even when the other hybrids raised from seed from the same capsule havea considerable degree of fertility these facts show how completelyfertility in the hybrid is independent of its external resemblance toeither pure parent considering the several rules now given which govern the fertilityof first crosses and of hybrids we see that when forms which must beconsidered as good and distinct species are united their fertilitygraduates from zero to perfect fertility or even to fertility undercertain conditions in excess that their fertility besides beingeminently susceptible to favourable and unfavourable conditions isinnately variable that it is by no means always the same in degree inthe first cross and in the hybrids produced from this cross that thefertility of hybrids is not related to the degree in which they resemblein external appearance either parent and lastly that the facility ofmaking a first cross between any two species is not always governed bytheir systematic affinity or degree of resemblance to each other thislatter statement is clearly proved by reciprocal crosses between thesame two species for according as the one species or the other is usedas the father or the mother there is generally some difference and occasionally the widest possible difference in the facility ofeffecting an union the hybrids moreover produced from reciprocalcrosses often differ in fertility now do these complex and singular rules indicate that species have beenendowed with sterility simply to prevent their becoming confoundedin nature i think not for why should the sterility be so extremelydifferent in degree when various species are crossed all of whichwe must suppose it would be equally important to keep from blendingtogether why should the degree of sterility be innately variable inthe individuals of the same species why should some species cross withfacility and yet produce very sterile hybrids and other species crosswith extreme difficulty and yet produce fairly fertile hybrids why should there often be so great a difference in the result of areciprocal cross between the same two species why it may even beasked has the production of hybrids been permitted to grant to speciesthe special power of producing hybrids and then to stop their furtherpropagation by different degrees of sterility not strictly related tothe facility of the first union between their parents seems to be astrange arrangement the foregoing rules and facts on the other hand appear to me clearlyto indicate that the sterility both of first crosses and of hybrids issimply incidental or dependent on unknown differences chiefly in thereproductive systems of the species which are crossed the differencesbeing of so peculiar and limited a nature that in reciprocal crossesbetween two species the male sexual element of the one will often freelyact on the female sexual element of the other but not in a reverseddirection it will be advisable to explain a little more fully by anexample what i mean by sterility being incidental on other differences and not a specially endowed quality as the capacity of one plant to begrafted or budded on another is so entirely unimportant for its welfarein a state of nature i presume that no one will suppose that thiscapacity is a specially endowed quality but will admit that it isincidental on differences in the laws of growth of the two plants wecan sometimes see the reason why one tree will not take on another fromdifferences in their rate of growth in the hardness of their wood inthe period of the flow or nature of their sap etc but in a multitudeof cases we can assign no reason whatever great diversity in the sizeof two plants one being woody and the other herbaceous one beingevergreen and the other deciduous and adaptation to widely differentclimates does not always prevent the two grafting together as inhybridisation so with grafting the capacity is limited by systematicaffinity for no one has been able to graft trees together belonging toquite distinct families and on the other hand closely allied species and varieties of the same species can usually but not invariably be grafted with ease but this capacity as in hybridisation is by nomeans absolutely governed by systematic affinity although many distinctgenera within the same family have been grafted together in other casesspecies of the same genus will not take on each other the pear can begrafted far more readily on the quince which is ranked as a distinctgenus than on the apple which is a member of the same genus evendifferent varieties of the pear take with different degrees of facilityon the quince so do different varieties of the apricot and peach oncertain varieties of the plum as gartner found that there was sometimes an innate difference indifferent individuals of the same two species in crossing so sagaretbelieves this to be the case with different individuals of the sametwo species in being grafted together as in reciprocal crosses thefacility of effecting an union is often very far from equal so itsometimes is in grafting the common gooseberry for instance cannotbe grafted on the currant whereas the currant will take though withdifficulty on the gooseberry we have seen that the sterility of hybrids which have theirreproductive organs in an imperfect condition is a very differentcase from the difficulty of uniting two pure species which have theirreproductive organs perfect yet these two distinct cases run to acertain extent parallel something analogous occurs in grafting forthouin found that three species of robinia which seeded freely ontheir own roots and which could be grafted with no great difficulty onanother species when thus grafted were rendered barren on the otherhand certain species of sorbus when grafted on other species yieldedtwice as much fruit as when on their own roots we are reminded by thislatter fact of the extraordinary case of hippeastrum lobelia etc which seeded much more freely when fertilised with the pollen ofdistinct species than when self fertilised with their own pollen we thus see that although there is a clear and fundamental differencebetween the mere adhesion of grafted stocks and the union of the maleand female elements in the act of reproduction yet that there is arude degree of parallelism in the results of grafting and of crossingdistinct species and as we must look at the curious and complex lawsgoverning the facility with which trees can be grafted on each otheras incidental on unknown differences in their vegetative systems so ibelieve that the still more complex laws governing the facility offirst crosses are incidental on unknown differences chiefly in theirreproductive systems these differences in both cases follow to acertain extent as might have been expected systematic affinity bywhich every kind of resemblance and dissimilarity between organicbeings is attempted to be expressed the facts by no means seem to meto indicate that the greater or lesser difficulty of either grafting orcrossing together various species has been a special endowment although in the case of crossing the difficulty is as important for theendurance and stability of specific forms as in the case of grafting itis unimportant for their welfare causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids we may now look a little closer at the probable causes of the sterilityof first crosses and of hybrids these two cases are fundamentallydifferent for as just remarked in the union of two pure species themale and female sexual elements are perfect whereas in hybrids they areimperfect even in first crosses the greater or lesser difficulty ineffecting a union apparently depends on several distinct causes theremust sometimes be a physical impossibility in the male element reachingthe ovule as would be the case with a plant having a pistil too longfor the pollen tubes to reach the ovarium it has also been observedthat when pollen of one species is placed on the stigma of a distantlyallied species though the pollen tubes protrude they do not penetratethe stigmatic surface again the male element may reach the femaleelement but be incapable of causing an embryo to be developed as seemsto have been the case with some of thuret s experiments on fuci noexplanation can be given of these facts any more than why certain treescannot be grafted on others lastly an embryo may be developed andthen perish at an early period this latter alternative has not beensufficiently attended to but i believe from observations communicatedto me by mr hewitt who has had great experience in hybridisinggallinaceous birds that the early death of the embryo is a veryfrequent cause of sterility in first crosses i was at first veryunwilling to believe in this view as hybrids when once born aregenerally healthy and long lived as we see in the case of the commonmule hybrids however are differently circumstanced before and afterbirth when born and living in a country where their two parents canlive they are generally placed under suitable conditions of life buta hybrid partakes of only half of the nature and constitution of itsmother and therefore before birth as long as it is nourished withinits mother s womb or within the egg or seed produced by the mother itmay be exposed to conditions in some degree unsuitable and consequentlybe liable to perish at an early period more especially as all veryyoung beings seem eminently sensitive to injurious or unnaturalconditions of life in regard to the sterility of hybrids in which the sexual elements areimperfectly developed the case is very different i have more than oncealluded to a large body of facts which i have collected showing thatwhen animals and plants are removed from their natural conditions they are extremely liable to have their reproductive systems seriouslyaffected this in fact is the great bar to the domestication ofanimals between the sterility thus superinduced and that of hybrids there are many points of similarity in both cases the sterility isindependent of general health and is often accompanied by excess ofsize or great luxuriance in both cases the sterility occurs in variousdegrees in both the male element is the most liable to be affected but sometimes the female more than the male in both the tendencygoes to a certain extent with systematic affinity for whole groupsof animals and plants are rendered impotent by the same unnaturalconditions and whole groups of species tend to produce sterile hybrids on the other hand one species in a group will sometimes resist greatchanges of conditions with unimpaired fertility and certain species ina group will produce unusually fertile hybrids no one can tell till hetries whether any particular animal will breed under confinement or anyplant seed freely under culture nor can he tell till he tries whetherany two species of a genus will produce more or less sterile hybrids lastly when organic beings are placed during several generations underconditions not natural to them they are extremely liable to vary which is due as i believe to their reproductive systems having beenspecially affected though in a lesser degree than when sterilityensues so it is with hybrids for hybrids in successive generations areeminently liable to vary as every experimentalist has observed thus we see that when organic beings are placed under new and unnaturalconditions and when hybrids are produced by the unnatural crossing oftwo species the reproductive system independently of the general stateof health is affected by sterility in a very similar manner in theone case the conditions of life have been disturbed though often in soslight a degree as to be inappreciable by us in the other case orthat of hybrids the external conditions have remained the same butthe organisation has been disturbed by two different structures andconstitutions having been blended into one for it is scarcely possiblethat two organisations should be compounded into one without somedisturbance occurring in the development or periodical action ormutual relation of the different parts and organs one to another or tothe conditions of life when hybrids are able to breed inter se theytransmit to their offspring from generation to generation the samecompounded organisation and hence we need not be surprised that theirsterility though in some degree variable rarely diminishes it must however be confessed that we cannot understand exceptingon vague hypotheses several facts with respect to the sterility ofhybrids for instance the unequal fertility of hybrids produced fromreciprocal crosses or the increased sterility in those hybrids whichoccasionally and exceptionally resemble closely either pure parent nordo i pretend that the foregoing remarks go to the root of the matter no explanation is offered why an organism when placed under unnaturalconditions is rendered sterile all that i have attempted to show is that in two cases in some respects allied sterility is the commonresult in the one case from the conditions of life having beendisturbed in the other case from the organisation having been disturbedby two organisations having been compounded into one it may seem fanciful but i suspect that a similar parallelism extendsto an allied yet very different class of facts it is an old and almostuniversal belief founded i think on a considerable body of evidence that slight changes in the conditions of life are beneficial to allliving things we see this acted on by farmers and gardeners in theirfrequent exchanges of seed tubers etc from one soil or climate toanother and back again during the convalescence of animals we plainlysee that great benefit is derived from almost any change in thehabits of life again both with plants and animals there is abundantevidence that a cross between very distinct individuals of the samespecies that is between members of different strains or sub breeds gives vigour and fertility to the offspring i believe indeed fromthe facts alluded to in our fourth chapter that a certain amount ofcrossing is indispensable even with hermaphrodites and that closeinterbreeding continued during several generations between the nearestrelations especially if these be kept under the same conditions oflife always induces weakness and sterility in the progeny hence it seems that on the one hand slight changes in the conditionsof life benefit all organic beings and on the other hand that slightcrosses that is crosses between the males and females of the samespecies which have varied and become slightly different give vigour andfertility to the offspring but we have seen that greater changes orchanges of a particular nature often render organic beings in somedegree sterile and that greater crosses that is crosses between malesand females which have become widely or specifically different producehybrids which are generally sterile in some degree i cannot persuademyself that this parallelism is an accident or an illusion both seriesof facts seem to be connected together by some common but unknown bond which is essentially related to the principle of life fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring it may be urged as a most forcible argument that there must be someessential distinction between species and varieties and that theremust be some error in all the foregoing remarks inasmuch as varieties however much they may differ from each other in external appearance cross with perfect facility and yield perfectly fertile offspring ifully admit that this is almost invariably the case but if we look tovarieties produced under nature we are immediately involved in hopelessdifficulties for if two hitherto reputed varieties be found in anydegree sterile together they are at once ranked by most naturalistsas species for instance the blue and red pimpernel the primroseand cowslip which are considered by many of our best botanists asvarieties are said by gartner not to be quite fertile when crossed andhe consequently ranks them as undoubted species if we thus argue ina circle the fertility of all varieties produced under nature willassuredly have to be granted if we turn to varieties produced or supposed to have been produced under domestication we are still involved in doubt for when it isstated for instance that the german spitz dog unites more easilythan other dogs with foxes or that certain south american indigenousdomestic dogs do not readily cross with european dogs the explanationwhich will occur to everyone and probably the true one is thatthese dogs have descended from several aboriginally distinct species nevertheless the perfect fertility of so many domestic varieties differing widely from each other in appearance for instance of thepigeon or of the cabbage is a remarkable fact more especially when wereflect how many species there are which though resembling eachother most closely are utterly sterile when intercrossed severalconsiderations however render the fertility of domestic varieties lessremarkable than at first appears it can in the first place be clearlyshown that mere external dissimilarity between two species does notdetermine their greater or lesser degree of sterility when crossed andwe may apply the same rule to domestic varieties in the second place some eminent naturalists believe that a long course of domesticationtends to eliminate sterility in the successive generations of hybrids which were at first only slightly sterile and if this be so we surelyought not to expect to find sterility both appearing and disappearingunder nearly the same conditions of life lastly and this seems to meby far the most important consideration new races of animals and plantsare produced under domestication by man s methodical and unconsciouspower of selection for his own use and pleasure he neither wishes toselect nor could select slight differences in the reproductive system or other constitutional differences correlated with the reproductivesystem he supplies his several varieties with the same food treatsthem in nearly the same manner and does not wish to alter their generalhabits of life nature acts uniformly and slowly during vast periodsof time on the whole organisation in any way which may be for eachcreature s own good and thus she may either directly or more probablyindirectly through correlation modify the reproductive system in theseveral descendants from any one species seeing this difference in theprocess of selection as carried on by man and nature we need not besurprised at some difference in the result i have as yet spoken as if the varieties of the same species wereinvariably fertile when intercrossed but it seems to me impossible toresist the evidence of the existence of a certain amount of sterility inthe few following cases which i will briefly abstract the evidenceis at least as good as that from which we believe in the sterility ofa multitude of species the evidence is also derived from hostilewitnesses who in all other cases consider fertility and sterility assafe criterions of specific distinction gartner kept during severalyears a dwarf kind of maize with yellow seeds and a tall variety withred seeds growing near each other in his garden and although theseplants have separated sexes they never naturally crossed he thenfertilised thirteen flowers of the one with the pollen of the other butonly a single head produced any seed and this one head produced onlyfive grains manipulation in this case could not have been injurious asthe plants have separated sexes no one i believe has suspected thatthese varieties of maize are distinct species and it is important tonotice that the hybrid plants thus raised were themselves perfectlyfertile so that even gartner did not venture to consider the twovarieties as specifically distinct girou de buzareingues crossed three varieties of gourd which likethe maize has separated sexes and he asserts that their mutualfertilisation is by so much the less easy as their differences aregreater how far these experiments may be trusted i know not but theforms experimentised on are ranked by sagaret who mainly founds hisclassification by the test of infertility as varieties the following case is far more remarkable and seems at first quiteincredible but it is the result of an astonishing number of experimentsmade during many years on nine species of verbascum by so good anobserver and so hostile a witness as gartner namely that yellowand white varieties of the same species of verbascum when intercrossedproduce less seed than do either coloured varieties when fertilisedwith pollen from their own coloured flowers moreover he asserts thatwhen yellow and white varieties of one species are crossed with yellowand white varieties of a distinct species more seed is produced by thecrosses between the same coloured flowers than between those which aredifferently coloured yet these varieties of verbascum present no otherdifference besides the mere colour of the flower and one variety cansometimes be raised from the seed of the other from observations which i have made on certain varieties of hollyhock iam inclined to suspect that they present analogous facts kolreuter whose accuracy has been confirmed by every subsequentobserver has proved the remarkable fact that one variety of the commontobacco is more fertile when crossed with a widely distinct species than are the other varieties he experimentised on five forms which arecommonly reputed to be varieties and which he tested by the severesttrial namely by reciprocal crosses and he found their mongreloffspring perfectly fertile but one of these five varieties when usedeither as father or mother and crossed with the nicotiana glutinosa always yielded hybrids not so sterile as those which were producedfrom the four other varieties when crossed with n glutinosa hence thereproductive system of this one variety must have been in some mannerand in some degree modified from these facts from the great difficulty of ascertaining theinfertility of varieties in a state of nature for a supposed variety ifinfertile in any degree would generally be ranked as species fromman selecting only external characters in the production of the mostdistinct domestic varieties and from not wishing or being able toproduce recondite and functional differences in the reproductive system from these several considerations and facts i do not think that thevery general fertility of varieties can be proved to be of universaloccurrence or to form a fundamental distinction between varietiesand species the general fertility of varieties does not seem to mesufficient to overthrow the view which i have taken with respect tothe very general but not invariable sterility of first crosses and ofhybrids namely that it is not a special endowment but is incidentalon slowly acquired modifications more especially in the reproductivesystems of the forms which are crossed hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility independently of the question of fertility the offspring of specieswhen crossed and of varieties when crossed may be compared in severalother respects gartner whose strong wish was to draw a marked line ofdistinction between species and varieties could find very few and as it seems to me quite unimportant differences between the so calledhybrid offspring of species and the so called mongrel offspring ofvarieties and on the other hand they agree most closely in very manyimportant respects i shall here discuss this subject with extreme brevity the mostimportant distinction is that in the first generation mongrels aremore variable than hybrids but gartner admits that hybrids fromspecies which have long been cultivated are often variable in the firstgeneration and i have myself seen striking instances of this fact gartner further admits that hybrids between very closely allied speciesare more variable than those from very distinct species and this showsthat the difference in the degree of variability graduates away when mongrels and the more fertile hybrids are propagated for severalgenerations an extreme amount of variability in their offspringis notorious but some few cases both of hybrids and mongrels longretaining uniformity of character could be given the variability however in the successive generations of mongrels is perhaps greaterthan in hybrids this greater variability of mongrels than of hybrids does not seem to meat all surprising for the parents of mongrels are varieties and mostlydomestic varieties very few experiments having been tried on naturalvarieties and this implies in most cases that there has been recentvariability and therefore we might expect that such variability wouldoften continue and be super added to that arising from the mere act ofcrossing the slight degree of variability in hybrids from the firstcross or in the first generation in contrast with their extremevariability in the succeeding generations is a curious fact anddeserves attention for it bears on and corroborates the view which ihave taken on the cause of ordinary variability namely that it is dueto the reproductive system being eminently sensitive to any change inthe conditions of life being thus often rendered either impotent or atleast incapable of its proper function of producing offspring identicalwith the parent form now hybrids in the first generation are descendedfrom species excluding those long cultivated which have not had theirreproductive systems in any way affected and they are not variable buthybrids themselves have their reproductive systems seriously affected and their descendants are highly variable but to return to our comparison of mongrels and hybrids gartnerstates that mongrels are more liable than hybrids to revert to eitherparent form but this if it be true is certainly only a difference indegree gartner further insists that when any two species althoughmost closely allied to each other are crossed with a third species the hybrids are widely different from each other whereas if two verydistinct varieties of one species are crossed with another species thehybrids do not differ much but this conclusion as far as i can makeout is founded on a single experiment and seems directly opposed tothe results of several experiments made by kolreuter these alone are the unimportant differences which gartner is able topoint out between hybrid and mongrel plants on the other hand theresemblance in mongrels and in hybrids to their respective parents more especially in hybrids produced from nearly related species followsaccording to gartner the same laws when two species are crossed one has sometimes a prepotent power of impressing its likeness on thehybrid and so i believe it to be with varieties of plants with animalsone variety certainly often has this prepotent power over anothervariety hybrid plants produced from a reciprocal cross generallyresemble each other closely and so it is with mongrels from areciprocal cross both hybrids and mongrels can be reduced to eitherpure parent form by repeated crosses in successive generations witheither parent these several remarks are apparently applicable to animals but thesubject is here excessively complicated partly owing to the existenceof secondary sexual characters but more especially owing to prepotencyin transmitting likeness running more strongly in one sex than in theother both when one species is crossed with another and when onevariety is crossed with another variety for instance i think thoseauthors are right who maintain that the ass has a prepotent power overthe horse so that both the mule and the hinny more resemble the assthan the horse but that the prepotency runs more strongly in themale ass than in the female so that the mule which is the offspring ofthe male ass and mare is more like an ass than is the hinny which isthe offspring of the female ass and stallion much stress has been laid by some authors on the supposed fact thatmongrel animals alone are born closely like one of their parents butit can be shown that this does sometimes occur with hybrids yet i grantmuch less frequently with hybrids than with mongrels looking to thecases which i have collected of cross bred animals closely resemblingone parent the resemblances seem chiefly confined to characters almostmonstrous in their nature and which have suddenly appeared such asalbinism melanism deficiency of tail or horns or additional fingersand toes and do not relate to characters which have been slowlyacquired by selection consequently sudden reversions to the perfectcharacter of either parent would be more likely to occur with mongrels which are descended from varieties often suddenly produced andsemi monstrous in character than with hybrids which are descended fromspecies slowly and naturally produced on the whole i entirely agreewith dr prosper lucas who after arranging an enormous body of factswith respect to animals comes to the conclusion that the laws ofresemblance of the child to its parents are the same whether the twoparents differ much or little from each other namely in the unionof individuals of the same variety or of different varieties or ofdistinct species laying aside the question of fertility and sterility in all otherrespects there seems to be a general and close similarity in theoffspring of crossed species and of crossed varieties if we look atspecies as having been specially created and at varieties as havingbeen produced by secondary laws this similarity would be an astonishingfact but it harmonises perfectly with the view that there is noessential distinction between species and varieties summary of chapter first crosses between forms sufficiently distinct to be ranked asspecies and their hybrids are very generally but not universally sterile the sterility is of all degrees and is often so slight thatthe two most careful experimentalists who have ever lived have come todiametrically opposite conclusions in ranking forms by this test thesterility is innately variable in individuals of the same species andis eminently susceptible of favourable and unfavourable conditions thedegree of sterility does not strictly follow systematic affinity but isgoverned by several curious and complex laws it is generally different and sometimes widely different in reciprocal crosses between the sametwo species it is not always equal in degree in a first cross and inthe hybrid produced from this cross in the same manner as in grafting trees the capacity of one speciesor variety to take on another is incidental on generally unknowndifferences in their vegetative systems so in crossing the greateror less facility of one species to unite with another is incidentalon unknown differences in their reproductive systems there is no morereason to think that species have been specially endowed with variousdegrees of sterility to prevent them crossing and blending in nature than to think that trees have been specially endowed with various andsomewhat analogous degrees of difficulty in being grafted together inorder to prevent them becoming inarched in our forests the sterility of first crosses between pure species which have theirreproductive systems perfect seems to depend on several circumstances in some cases largely on the early death of the embryo the sterility ofhybrids which have their reproductive systems imperfect and whichhave had this system and their whole organisation disturbed by beingcompounded of two distinct species seems closely allied to thatsterility which so frequently affects pure species when their naturalconditions of life have been disturbed this view is supported by aparallelism of another kind namely that the crossing of forms onlyslightly different is favourable to the vigour and fertility of theiroffspring and that slight changes in the conditions of life areapparently favourable to the vigour and fertility of all organic beings it is not surprising that the degree of difficulty in uniting twospecies and the degree of sterility of their hybrid offspring shouldgenerally correspond though due to distinct causes for both dependon the amount of difference of some kind between the species which arecrossed nor is it surprising that the facility of effecting a firstcross the fertility of the hybrids produced and the capacity of beinggrafted together though this latter capacity evidently depends onwidely different circumstances should all run to a certain extent parallel with the systematic affinity of the forms which are subjectedto experiment for systematic affinity attempts to express all kinds ofresemblance between all species first crosses between forms known to be varieties or sufficiently aliketo be considered as varieties and their mongrel offspring are verygenerally but not quite universally fertile nor is this nearlygeneral and perfect fertility surprising when we remember how liable weare to argue in a circle with respect to varieties in a state of nature and when we remember that the greater number of varieties havebeen produced under domestication by the selection of mere externaldifferences and not of differences in the reproductive system inall other respects excluding fertility there is a close generalresemblance between hybrids and mongrels finally then the factsbriefly given in this chapter do not seem to me opposed to but evenrather to support the view that there is no fundamental distinctionbetween species and varieties on the imperfection of the geological record on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day on thenature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number on thevast lapse of time as inferred from the rate of deposition and ofdenudation on the poorness of our palaeontological collections on theintermittence of geological formations on the absence of intermediatevarieties in any one formation on the sudden appearance of groups ofspecies on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferousstrata in the sixth chapter i enumerated the chief objections which might bejustly urged against the views maintained in this volume most of themhave now been discussed one namely the distinctness of specific forms and their not being blended together by innumerable transitional links is a very obvious difficulty i assigned reasons why such links do notcommonly occur at the present day under the circumstances apparentlymost favourable for their presence namely on an extensive andcontinuous area with graduated physical conditions i endeavoured toshow that the life of each species depends in a more important manneron the presence of other already defined organic forms than on climate and therefore that the really governing conditions of life do notgraduate away quite insensibly like heat or moisture i endeavoured also to show that intermediate varieties from existing in lessernumbers than the forms which they connect will generally be beatenout and exterminated during the course of further modification andimprovement the main cause however of innumerable intermediate linksnot now occurring everywhere throughout nature depends on the veryprocess of natural selection through which new varieties continuallytake the places of and exterminate their parent forms but just inproportion as this process of extermination has acted on an enormousscale so must the number of intermediate varieties which haveformerly existed on the earth be truly enormous why then is not everygeological formation and every stratum full of such intermediate links geology assuredly does not reveal any such finely graduated organicchain and this perhaps is the most obvious and gravest objectionwhich can be urged against my theory the explanation lies as ibelieve in the extreme imperfection of the geological record in the first place it should always be borne in mind what sort ofintermediate forms must on my theory have formerly existed i havefound it difficult when looking at any two species to avoid picturingto myself forms directly intermediate between them but this is awholly false view we should always look for forms intermediate betweeneach species and a common but unknown progenitor and the progenitorwill generally have differed in some respects from all its modifieddescendants to give a simple illustration the fantail and pouterpigeons have both descended from the rock pigeon if we possessed allthe intermediate varieties which have ever existed we should have anextremely close series between both and the rock pigeon but we shouldhave no varieties directly intermediate between the fantail and pouter none for instance combining a tail somewhat expanded with a cropsomewhat enlarged the characteristic features of these two breeds these two breeds moreover have become so much modified that if we hadno historical or indirect evidence regarding their origin it would nothave been possible to have determined from a mere comparison of theirstructure with that of the rock pigeon whether they had descended fromthis species or from some other allied species such as c oenas so with natural species if we look to forms very distinct for instanceto the horse and tapir we have no reason to suppose that links everexisted directly intermediate between them but between each and anunknown common parent the common parent will have had in its wholeorganisation much general resemblance to the tapir and to the horse butin some points of structure may have differed considerably from both even perhaps more than they differ from each other hence in all suchcases we should be unable to recognise the parent form of any two ormore species even if we closely compared the structure of the parentwith that of its modified descendants unless at the same time we had anearly perfect chain of the intermediate links it is just possible by my theory that one of two living forms mighthave descended from the other for instance a horse from a tapir andin this case direct intermediate links will have existed between them but such a case would imply that one form had remained for a very longperiod unaltered whilst its descendants had undergone a vast amount ofchange and the principle of competition between organism and organism between child and parent will render this a very rare event for in allcases the new and improved forms of life will tend to supplant the oldand unimproved forms by the theory of natural selection all living species have beenconnected with the parent species of each genus by differences notgreater than we see between the varieties of the same species at thepresent day and these parent species now generally extinct have intheir turn been similarly connected with more ancient species and so onbackwards always converging to the common ancestor of each great class so that the number of intermediate and transitional links between allliving and extinct species must have been inconceivably great butassuredly if this theory be true such have lived upon this earth on the lapse of time independently of our not finding fossil remains of such infinitelynumerous connecting links it may be objected that time will not havesufficed for so great an amount of organic change all changes havingbeen effected very slowly through natural selection it is hardlypossible for me even to recall to the reader who may not be a practicalgeologist the facts leading the mind feebly to comprehend the lapse oftime he who can read sir charles lyell s grand work on the principlesof geology which the future historian will recognise as having produceda revolution in natural science yet does not admit how incomprehensiblyvast have been the past periods of time may at once close this volume not that it suffices to study the principles of geology or to readspecial treatises by different observers on separate formations and tomark how each author attempts to give an inadequate idea of the durationof each formation or even each stratum a man must for years examine forhimself great piles of superimposed strata and watch the sea at workgrinding down old rocks and making fresh sediment before he can hope tocomprehend anything of the lapse of time the monuments of which we seearound us it is good to wander along lines of sea coast when formed of moderatelyhard rocks and mark the process of degradation the tides in most casesreach the cliffs only for a short time twice a day and the waves eatinto them only when they are charged with sand or pebbles for thereis reason to believe that pure water can effect little or nothing inwearing away rock at last the base of the cliff is undermined hugefragments fall down and these remaining fixed have to be worn away atom by atom until reduced in size they can be rolled about by thewaves and then are more quickly ground into pebbles sand or mud but how often do we see along the bases of retreating cliffs roundedboulders all thickly clothed by marine productions showing how littlethey are abraded and how seldom they are rolled about moreover ifwe follow for a few miles any line of rocky cliff which is undergoingdegradation we find that it is only here and there along a shortlength or round a promontory that the cliffs are at the present timesuffering the appearance of the surface and the vegetation show thatelsewhere years have elapsed since the waters washed their base he who most closely studies the action of the sea on our shores will i believe be most deeply impressed with the slowness with which rockycoasts are worn away the observations on this head by hugh miller and by that excellent observer mr smith of jordan hill are mostimpressive with the mind thus impressed let any one examine beds ofconglomerate many thousand feet in thickness which though probablyformed at a quicker rate than many other deposits yet from beingformed of worn and rounded pebbles each of which bears the stamp oftime are good to show how slowly the mass has been accumulated lethim remember lyell s profound remark that the thickness and extent ofsedimentary formations are the result and measure of the degradationwhich the earth s crust has elsewhere suffered and what an amount ofdegradation is implied by the sedimentary deposits of many countries professor ramsay has given me the maximum thickness in most cases fromactual measurement in a few cases from estimate of each formation indifferent parts of great britain and this is the result feet palaeozoic strata not including igneous beds secondary strata tertiary strata making altogether feet that is very nearly thirteen andthree quarters british miles some of these formations which arerepresented in england by thin beds are thousands of feet in thicknesson the continent moreover between each successive formation we have in the opinion of most geologists enormously long blank periods so that the lofty pile of sedimentary rocks in britain gives but aninadequate idea of the time which has elapsed during their accumulation yet what time this must have consumed good observers have estimatedthat sediment is deposited by the great mississippi river at the rateof only feet in a hundred thousand years this estimate may be quiteerroneous yet considering over what wide spaces very fine sediment istransported by the currents of the sea the process of accumulation inany one area must be extremely slow but the amount of denudation which the strata have in many placessuffered independently of the rate of accumulation of the degradedmatter probably offers the best evidence of the lapse of time iremember having been much struck with the evidence of denudation whenviewing volcanic islands which have been worn by the waves and paredall round into perpendicular cliffs of one or two thousand feet inheight for the gentle slope of the lava streams due to their formerlyliquid state showed at a glance how far the hard rocky beds had onceextended into the open ocean the same story is still more plainly toldby faults those great cracks along which the strata have been upheavedon one side or thrown down on the other to the height or depth ofthousands of feet for since the crust cracked the surface of the landhas been so completely planed down by the action of the sea that notrace of these vast dislocations is externally visible the craven fault for instance extends for upwards of miles andalong this line the vertical displacement of the strata has variedfrom to feet professor ramsay has published an account ofa downthrow in anglesea of feet and he informs me that he fullybelieves there is one in merionethshire of feet yet in thesecases there is nothing on the surface to show such prodigious movements the pile of rocks on the one or other side having been smoothly sweptaway the consideration of these facts impresses my mind almost inthe same manner as does the vain endeavour to grapple with the idea ofeternity i am tempted to give one other case the well known one of thedenudation of the weald though it must be admitted that the denudationof the weald has been a mere trifle in comparison with that which hasremoved masses of our palaeozoic strata in parts ten thousand feetin thickness as shown in professor ramsay s masterly memoir on thissubject yet it is an admirable lesson to stand on the north downs andto look at the distant south downs for remembering that at no greatdistance to the west the northern and southern escarpments meet andclose one can safely picture to oneself the great dome of rocks whichmust have covered up the weald within so limited a period as since thelatter part of the chalk formation the distance from the northern tothe southern downs is about miles and the thickness of the severalformations is on an average about feet as i am informed byprofessor ramsay but if as some geologists suppose a range ofolder rocks underlies the weald on the flanks of which the overlyingsedimentary deposits might have accumulated in thinner masses thanelsewhere the above estimate would be erroneous but this source ofdoubt probably would not greatly affect the estimate as applied to thewestern extremity of the district if then we knew the rate at whichthe sea commonly wears away a line of cliff of any given height wecould measure the time requisite to have denuded the weald this ofcourse cannot be done but we may in order to form some crude notionon the subject assume that the sea would eat into cliffs feet inheight at the rate of one inch in a century this will at first appearmuch too small an allowance but it is the same as if we were to assumea cliff one yard in height to be eaten back along a whole line ofcoast at the rate of one yard in nearly every twenty two years idoubt whether any rock even as soft as chalk would yield at this rateexcepting on the most exposed coasts though no doubt the degradationof a lofty cliff would be more rapid from the breakage of the fallenfragments on the other hand i do not believe that any line of coast ten or twenty miles in length ever suffers degradation at the same timealong its whole indented length and we must remember that almost allstrata contain harder layers or nodules which from long resistingattrition form a breakwater at the base hence under ordinarycircumstances i conclude that for a cliff feet in height adenudation of one inch per century for the whole length would be anample allowance at this rate on the above data the denudation of theweald must have required years or say three hundred millionyears the action of fresh water on the gently inclined wealden district whenupraised could hardly have been great but it would somewhat reduce theabove estimate on the other hand during oscillations of level whichwe know this area has undergone the surface may have existed formillions of years as land and thus have escaped the action of thesea when deeply submerged for perhaps equally long periods it would likewise have escaped the action of the coast waves so that in allprobability a far longer period than million years has elapsed sincethe latter part of the secondary period i have made these few remarks because it is highly important for us togain some notion however imperfect of the lapse of years during eachof these years over the whole world the land and the water hasbeen peopled by hosts of living forms what an infinite number ofgenerations which the mind cannot grasp must have succeeded each otherin the long roll of years now turn to our richest geological museums and what a paltry display we behold on the poorness of our palaeontological collections that our palaeontological collections are very imperfect is admitted byevery one the remark of that admirable palaeontologist the late edwardforbes should not be forgotten namely that numbers of our fossilspecies are known and named from single and often broken specimens orfrom a few specimens collected on some one spot only a small portionof the surface of the earth has been geologically explored and no partwith sufficient care as the important discoveries made every year ineurope prove no organism wholly soft can be preserved shells andbones will decay and disappear when left on the bottom of the sea wheresediment is not accumulating i believe we are continually taking amost erroneous view when we tacitly admit to ourselves that sedimentis being deposited over nearly the whole bed of the sea at a ratesufficiently quick to embed and preserve fossil remains throughout anenormously large proportion of the ocean the bright blue tint of thewater bespeaks its purity the many cases on record of a formationconformably covered after an enormous interval of time by anotherand later formation without the underlying bed having suffered in theinterval any wear and tear seem explicable only on the view of thebottom of the sea not rarely lying for ages in an unaltered condition the remains which do become embedded if in sand or gravel will whenthe beds are upraised generally be dissolved by the percolation ofrain water i suspect that but few of the very many animals which liveon the beach between high and low watermark are preserved for instance the several species of the chthamalinae a sub family of sessilecirripedes coat the rocks all over the world in infinite numbers theyare all strictly littoral with the exception of a single mediterraneanspecies which inhabits deep water and has been found fossil in sicily whereas not one other species has hitherto been found in any tertiaryformation yet it is now known that the genus chthamalus existedduring the chalk period the molluscan genus chiton offers a partiallyanalogous case with respect to the terrestrial productions which lived during thesecondary and palaeozoic periods it is superfluous to state that ourevidence from fossil remains is fragmentary in an extreme degree forinstance not a land shell is known belonging to either of thesevast periods with one exception discovered by sir c lyell in thecarboniferous strata of north america in regard to mammiferous remains a single glance at the historical table published in the supplement tolyell s manual will bring home the truth how accidental and rare istheir preservation far better than pages of detail nor is their raritysurprising when we remember how large a proportion of the bones oftertiary mammals have been discovered either in caves or in lacustrinedeposits and that not a cave or true lacustrine bed is known belongingto the age of our secondary or palaeozoic formations but the imperfection in the geological record mainly results fromanother and more important cause than any of the foregoing namely fromthe several formations being separated from each other by wide intervalsof time when we see the formations tabulated in written works or whenwe follow them in nature it is difficult to avoid believing thatthey are closely consecutive but we know for instance from sir r murchison s great work on russia what wide gaps there are in thatcountry between the superimposed formations so it is in north america and in many other parts of the world the most skilful geologist ifhis attention had been exclusively confined to these large territories would never have suspected that during the periods which were blank andbarren in his own country great piles of sediment charged with new andpeculiar forms of life had elsewhere been accumulated and if in eachseparate territory hardly any idea can be formed of the length of timewhich has elapsed between the consecutive formations we may infer thatthis could nowhere be ascertained the frequent and great changes in themineralogical composition of consecutive formations generally implyinggreat changes in the geography of the surrounding lands whence thesediment has been derived accords with the belief of vast intervals oftime having elapsed between each formation but we can i think see why the geological formations of each regionare almost invariably intermittent that is have not followed eachother in close sequence scarcely any fact struck me more when examiningmany hundred miles of the south american coasts which have beenupraised several hundred feet within the recent period than the absenceof any recent deposits sufficiently extensive to last for even a shortgeological period along the whole west coast which is inhabited by apeculiar marine fauna tertiary beds are so scantily developed that norecord of several successive and peculiar marine faunas will probably bepreserved to a distant age a little reflection will explain why alongthe rising coast of the western side of south america no extensiveformations with recent or tertiary remains can anywhere be found thoughthe supply of sediment must for ages have been great from the enormousdegradation of the coast rocks and from muddy streams entering thesea the explanation no doubt is that the littoral and sub littoraldeposits are continually worn away as soon as they are brought up bythe slow and gradual rising of the land within the grinding action ofthe coast waves we may i think safely conclude that sediment must be accumulated inextremely thick solid or extensive masses in order to withstand theincessant action of the waves when first upraised and during subsequentoscillations of level such thick and extensive accumulations ofsediment may be formed in two ways either in profound depths of thesea in which case judging from the researches of e forbes we mayconclude that the bottom will be inhabited by extremely few animals andthe mass when upraised will give a most imperfect record of the formsof life which then existed or sediment may be accumulated to anythickness and extent over a shallow bottom if it continue slowly tosubside in this latter case as long as the rate of subsidence andsupply of sediment nearly balance each other the sea will remainshallow and favourable for life and thus a fossiliferous formationthick enough when upraised to resist any amount of degradation may beformed i am convinced that all our ancient formations which are rich infossils have thus been formed during subsidence since publishing myviews on this subject in i have watched the progress of geology and have been surprised to note how author after author in treatingof this or that great formation has come to the conclusion that it wasaccumulated during subsidence i may add that the only ancient tertiaryformation on the west coast of south america which has been bulkyenough to resist such degradation as it has as yet suffered but whichwill hardly last to a distant geological age was certainly depositedduring a downward oscillation of level and thus gained considerablethickness all geological facts tell us plainly that each area has undergonenumerous slow oscillations of level and apparently these oscillationshave affected wide spaces consequently formations rich in fossils andsufficiently thick and extensive to resist subsequent degradation mayhave been formed over wide spaces during periods of subsidence but onlywhere the supply of sediment was sufficient to keep the sea shallow andto embed and preserve the remains before they had time to decay on theother hand as long as the bed of the sea remained stationary thickdeposits could not have been accumulated in the shallow parts which arethe most favourable to life still less could this have happened duringthe alternate periods of elevation or to speak more accurately thebeds which were then accumulated will have been destroyed by beingupraised and brought within the limits of the coast action thus the geological record will almost necessarily be renderedintermittent i feel much confidence in the truth of these views forthey are in strict accordance with the general principles inculcatedby sir c lyell and e forbes independently arrived at a similarconclusion one remark is here worth a passing notice during periods of elevationthe area of the land and of the adjoining shoal parts of the sea willbe increased and new stations will often be formed all circumstancesmost favourable as previously explained for the formation of newvarieties and species but during such periods there will generally bea blank in the geological record on the other hand during subsidence the inhabited area and number of inhabitants will decrease exceptingthe productions on the shores of a continent when first broken up intoan archipelago and consequently during subsidence though there willbe much extinction fewer new varieties or species will be formed andit is during these very periods of subsidence that our great depositsrich in fossils have been accumulated nature may almost be said to haveguarded against the frequent discovery of her transitional or linkingforms from the foregoing considerations it cannot be doubted that thegeological record viewed as a whole is extremely imperfect but if weconfine our attention to any one formation it becomes more difficultto understand why we do not therein find closely graduated varietiesbetween the allied species which lived at its commencement and at itsclose some cases are on record of the same species presenting distinctvarieties in the upper and lower parts of the same formation but asthey are rare they may be here passed over although each formation hasindisputably required a vast number of years for its deposition i cansee several reasons why each should not include a graduated seriesof links between the species which then lived but i can by nomeans pretend to assign due proportional weight to the followingconsiderations although each formation may mark a very long lapse of years eachperhaps is short compared with the period requisite to change onespecies into another i am aware that two palaeontologists whoseopinions are worthy of much deference namely bronn and woodward haveconcluded that the average duration of each formation is twice or thriceas long as the average duration of specific forms but insuperabledifficulties as it seems to me prevent us coming to any justconclusion on this head when we see a species first appearing in themiddle of any formation it would be rash in the extreme to infer thatit had not elsewhere previously existed so again when we find a speciesdisappearing before the uppermost layers have been deposited it wouldbe equally rash to suppose that it then became wholly extinct we forgethow small the area of europe is compared with the rest of the world nor have the several stages of the same formation throughout europe beencorrelated with perfect accuracy with marine animals of all kinds we may safely infer a large amount ofmigration during climatal and other changes and when we see a speciesfirst appearing in any formation the probability is that it only thenfirst immigrated into that area it is well known for instance thatseveral species appeared somewhat earlier in the palaeozoic beds ofnorth america than in those of europe time having apparently beenrequired for their migration from the american to the european seas inexamining the latest deposits of various quarters of the world it haseverywhere been noted that some few still existing species are commonin the deposit but have become extinct in the immediately surroundingsea or conversely that some are now abundant in the neighbouring sea but are rare or absent in this particular deposit it is an excellentlesson to reflect on the ascertained amount of migration of theinhabitants of europe during the glacial period which forms only a partof one whole geological period and likewise to reflect on the greatchanges of level on the inordinately great change of climate on theprodigious lapse of time all included within this same glacial period yet it may be doubted whether in any quarter of the world sedimentarydeposits including fossil remains have gone on accumulating withinthe same area during the whole of this period it is not for instance probable that sediment was deposited during the whole of the glacialperiod near the mouth of the mississippi within that limit of depth atwhich marine animals can flourish for we know what vast geographicalchanges occurred in other parts of america during this space of time when such beds as were deposited in shallow water near the mouth ofthe mississippi during some part of the glacial period shall have beenupraised organic remains will probably first appear and disappear atdifferent levels owing to the migration of species and to geographicalchanges and in the distant future a geologist examining these beds might be tempted to conclude that the average duration of life of theembedded fossils had been less than that of the glacial period insteadof having been really far greater that is extending from before theglacial epoch to the present day in order to get a perfect gradation between two forms in the upperand lower parts of the same formation the deposit must have gone onaccumulating for a very long period in order to have given sufficienttime for the slow process of variation hence the deposit will generallyhave to be a very thick one and the species undergoing modificationwill have had to live on the same area throughout this whole time but we have seen that a thick fossiliferous formation can only beaccumulated during a period of subsidence and to keep the depthapproximately the same which is necessary in order to enable the samespecies to live on the same space the supply of sediment must nearlyhave counterbalanced the amount of subsidence but this same movementof subsidence will often tend to sink the area whence the sedimentis derived and thus diminish the supply whilst the downward movementcontinues in fact this nearly exact balancing between the supply ofsediment and the amount of subsidence is probably a rare contingency for it has been observed by more than one palaeontologist that verythick deposits are usually barren of organic remains except near theirupper or lower limits it would seem that each separate formation like the whole pile offormations in any country has generally been intermittent in itsaccumulation when we see as is so often the case a formation composedof beds of different mineralogical composition we may reasonablysuspect that the process of deposition has been much interrupted asa change in the currents of the sea and a supply of sediment of adifferent nature will generally have been due to geographical changesrequiring much time nor will the closest inspection of a formation giveany idea of the time which its deposition has consumed many instancescould be given of beds only a few feet in thickness representingformations elsewhere thousands of feet in thickness and which musthave required an enormous period for their accumulation yet no oneignorant of this fact would have suspected the vast lapse of timerepresented by the thinner formation many cases could be given of thelower beds of a formation having been upraised denuded submerged andthen re covered by the upper beds of the same formation facts showing what wide yet easily overlooked intervals have occurred inits accumulation in other cases we have the plainest evidence in greatfossilised trees still standing upright as they grew of many longintervals of time and changes of level during the process of deposition which would never even have been suspected had not the trees chanced tohave been preserved thus messrs lyell and dawson found carboniferousbeds feet thick in nova scotia with ancient root bearing strata one above the other at no less than sixty eight different levels hence when the same species occur at the bottom middle and top of aformation the probability is that they have not lived on the samespot during the whole period of deposition but have disappeared andreappeared perhaps many times during the same geological period so that if such species were to undergo a considerable amount ofmodification during any one geological period a section would notprobably include all the fine intermediate gradations which must onmy theory have existed between them but abrupt though perhaps veryslight changes of form it is all important to remember that naturalists have no golden ruleby which to distinguish species and varieties they grant some littlevariability to each species but when they meet with a somewhat greateramount of difference between any two forms they rank both as species unless they are enabled to connect them together by close intermediategradations and this from the reasons just assigned we can seldom hopeto effect in any one geological section supposing b and c to be twospecies and a third a to be found in an underlying bed even if awere strictly intermediate between b and c it would simply be ranked asa third and distinct species unless at the same time it could bemost closely connected with either one or both forms by intermediatevarieties nor should it be forgotten as before explained that amight be the actual progenitor of b and c and yet might not at allnecessarily be strictly intermediate between them in all points ofstructure so that we might obtain the parent species and its severalmodified descendants from the lower and upper beds of a formation and unless we obtained numerous transitional gradations we should notrecognise their relationship and should consequently be compelled torank them all as distinct species it is notorious on what excessively slight differences manypalaeontologists have founded their species and they do this the morereadily if the specimens come from different sub stages of the sameformation some experienced conchologists are now sinking many of thevery fine species of d orbigny and others into the rank of varieties and on this view we do find the kind of evidence of change which on mytheory we ought to find moreover if we look to rather wider intervals namely to distinct but consecutive stages of the same great formation we find that the embedded fossils though almost universally ranked asspecifically different yet are far more closely allied to each otherthan are the species found in more widely separated formations but tothis subject i shall have to return in the following chapter one other consideration is worth notice with animals and plants thatcan propagate rapidly and are not highly locomotive there is reason tosuspect as we have formerly seen that their varieties are generallyat first local and that such local varieties do not spread widely andsupplant their parent forms until they have been modified and perfectedin some considerable degree according to this view the chance ofdiscovering in a formation in any one country all the early stages oftransition between any two forms is small for the successive changesare supposed to have been local or confined to some one spot mostmarine animals have a wide range and we have seen that with plants itis those which have the widest range that oftenest present varieties so that with shells and other marine animals it is probably thosewhich have had the widest range far exceeding the limits of the knowngeological formations of europe which have oftenest given rise firstto local varieties and ultimately to new species and this again wouldgreatly lessen the chance of our being able to trace the stages oftransition in any one geological formation it should not be forgotten that at the present day with perfectspecimens for examination two forms can seldom be connected byintermediate varieties and thus proved to be the same species untilmany specimens have been collected from many places and in the caseof fossil species this could rarely be effected by palaeontologists weshall perhaps best perceive the improbability of our being enabled toconnect species by numerous fine intermediate fossil links by askingourselves whether for instance geologists at some future period willbe able to prove that our different breeds of cattle sheep horses and dogs have descended from a single stock or from several aboriginalstocks or again whether certain sea shells inhabiting the shoresof north america which are ranked by some conchologists as distinctspecies from their european representatives and by other conchologistsas only varieties are really varieties or are as it is called specifically distinct this could be effected only by the futuregeologist discovering in a fossil state numerous intermediategradations and such success seems to me improbable in the highestdegree geological research though it has added numerous species to existingand extinct genera and has made the intervals between some few groupsless wide than they otherwise would have been yet has done scarcelyanything in breaking down the distinction between species by connectingthem together by numerous fine intermediate varieties and this nothaving been effected is probably the gravest and most obvious of allthe many objections which may be urged against my views hence it willbe worth while to sum up the foregoing remarks under an imaginaryillustration the malay archipelago is of about the size of europe fromthe north cape to the mediterranean and from britain to russia andtherefore equals all the geological formations which have been examinedwith any accuracy excepting those of the united states of america ifully agree with mr godwin austen that the present condition of themalay archipelago with its numerous large islands separated by wide andshallow seas probably represents the former state of europe when mostof our formations were accumulating the malay archipelago is one ofthe richest regions of the whole world in organic beings yet if allthe species were to be collected which have ever lived there howimperfectly would they represent the natural history of the world but we have every reason to believe that the terrestrial productions ofthe archipelago would be preserved in an excessively imperfect manner inthe formations which we suppose to be there accumulating i suspect thatnot many of the strictly littoral animals or of those which lived onnaked submarine rocks would be embedded and those embedded in gravelor sand would not endure to a distant epoch wherever sediment did notaccumulate on the bed of the sea or where it did not accumulate at asufficient rate to protect organic bodies from decay no remains couldbe preserved in our archipelago i believe that fossiliferous formations could beformed of sufficient thickness to last to an age as distant in futurityas the secondary formations lie in the past only during periods ofsubsidence these periods of subsidence would be separated from eachother by enormous intervals during which the area would be eitherstationary or rising whilst rising each fossiliferous formationwould be destroyed almost as soon as accumulated by the incessantcoast action as we now see on the shores of south america during theperiods of subsidence there would probably be much extinction of life during the periods of elevation there would be much variation but thegeological record would then be least perfect it may be doubted whether the duration of any one great period ofsubsidence over the whole or part of the archipelago together witha contemporaneous accumulation of sediment would exceed the averageduration of the same specific forms and these contingencies areindispensable for the preservation of all the transitional gradationsbetween any two or more species if such gradations were not fullypreserved transitional varieties would merely appear as so manydistinct species it is also probable that each great period ofsubsidence would be interrupted by oscillations of level and thatslight climatal changes would intervene during such lengthy periods andin these cases the inhabitants of the archipelago would have to migrate and no closely consecutive record of their modifications could bepreserved in any one formation very many of the marine inhabitants of the archipelago now rangethousands of miles beyond its confines and analogy leads me to believethat it would be chiefly these far ranging species which would oftenestproduce new varieties and the varieties would at first generallybe local or confined to one place but if possessed of any decidedadvantage or when further modified and improved they would slowlyspread and supplant their parent forms when such varieties returned totheir ancient homes as they would differ from their former state ina nearly uniform though perhaps extremely slight degree they would according to the principles followed by many palaeontologists be rankedas new and distinct species if then there be some degree of truth in these remarks we have noright to expect to find in our geological formations an infinite numberof those fine transitional forms which on my theory assuredly haveconnected all the past and present species of the same group into onelong and branching chain of life we ought only to look for a few links some more closely some more distantly related to each other and theselinks let them be ever so close if found in different stages of thesame formation would by most palaeontologists be ranked as distinctspecies but i do not pretend that i should ever have suspected how poora record of the mutations of life the best preserved geological sectionpresented had not the difficulty of our not discovering innumerabletransitional links between the species which appeared at thecommencement and close of each formation pressed so hardly on mytheory on the sudden appearance of whole groups of allied species the abrupt manner in which whole groups of species suddenly appear incertain formations has been urged by several palaeontologists for instance by agassiz pictet and by none more forcibly thanby professor sedgwick as a fatal objection to the belief in thetransmutation of species if numerous species belonging to the samegenera or families have really started into life all at once the factwould be fatal to the theory of descent with slow modification throughnatural selection for the development of a group of forms all of whichhave descended from some one progenitor must have been an extremelyslow process and the progenitors must have lived long ages before theirmodified descendants but we continually over rate the perfection of thegeological record and falsely infer because certain genera or familieshave not been found beneath a certain stage that they did not existbefore that stage we continually forget how large the world is compared with the area over which our geological formations have beencarefully examined we forget that groups of species may elsewhere havelong existed and have slowly multiplied before they invaded the ancientarchipelagoes of europe and of the united states we do not make dueallowance for the enormous intervals of time which have probablyelapsed between our consecutive formations longer perhaps in somecases than the time required for the accumulation of each formation these intervals will have given time for the multiplication of speciesfrom some one or some few parent forms and in the succeeding formationsuch species will appear as if suddenly created i may here recall a remark formerly made namely that it might requirea long succession of ages to adapt an organism to some new and peculiarline of life for instance to fly through the air but that when thishad been effected and a few species had thus acquired a great advantageover other organisms a comparatively short time would be necessary toproduce many divergent forms which would be able to spread rapidly andwidely throughout the world i will now give a few examples to illustrate these remarks and to showhow liable we are to error in supposing that whole groups of specieshave suddenly been produced i may recall the well known fact that ingeological treatises published not many years ago the great classof mammals was always spoken of as having abruptly come in at thecommencement of the tertiary series and now one of the richest knownaccumulations of fossil mammals belongs to the middle of the secondaryseries and one true mammal has been discovered in the new red sandstoneat nearly the commencement of this great series cuvier used to urgethat no monkey occurred in any tertiary stratum but now extinct specieshave been discovered in india south america and in europe even as farback as the eocene stage the most striking case however is that ofthe whale family as these animals have huge bones are marine andrange over the world the fact of not a single bone of a whale havingbeen discovered in any secondary formation seemed fully to justify thebelief that this great and distinct order had been suddenly producedin the interval between the latest secondary and earliest tertiaryformation but now we may read in the supplement to lyell s manual published in clear evidence of the existence of whales in theupper greensand some time before the close of the secondary period i may give another instance which from having passed under my own eyeshas much struck me in a memoir on fossil sessile cirripedes i havestated that from the number of existing and extinct tertiary species from the extraordinary abundance of the individuals of many speciesall over the world from the arctic regions to the equator inhabitingvarious zones of depths from the upper tidal limits to fathoms from the perfect manner in which specimens are preserved in the oldesttertiary beds from the ease with which even a fragment of a valve canbe recognised from all these circumstances i inferred that had sessilecirripedes existed during the secondary periods they would certainlyhave been preserved and discovered and as not one species had beendiscovered in beds of this age i concluded that this great group hadbeen suddenly developed at the commencement of the tertiary series thiswas a sore trouble to me adding as i thought one more instance of theabrupt appearance of a great group of species but my work had hardlybeen published when a skilful palaeontologist m bosquet sent me adrawing of a perfect specimen of an unmistakeable sessile cirripede which he had himself extracted from the chalk of belgium and as ifto make the case as striking as possible this sessile cirripede was achthamalus a very common large and ubiquitous genus of which not onespecimen has as yet been found even in any tertiary stratum hence wenow positively know that sessile cirripedes existed during the secondaryperiod and these cirripedes might have been the progenitors of our manytertiary and existing species the case most frequently insisted on by palaeontologists of theapparently sudden appearance of a whole group of species is that of theteleostean fishes low down in the chalk period this group includes thelarge majority of existing species lately professor pictet has carriedtheir existence one sub stage further back and some palaeontologistsbelieve that certain much older fishes of which the affinities are asyet imperfectly known are really teleostean assuming however thatthe whole of them did appear as agassiz believes at the commencementof the chalk formation the fact would certainly be highly remarkable but i cannot see that it would be an insuperable difficulty on mytheory unless it could likewise be shown that the species of this groupappeared suddenly and simultaneously throughout the world at this sameperiod it is almost superfluous to remark that hardly any fossil fishare known from south of the equator and by running through pictet spalaeontology it will be seen that very few species are known fromseveral formations in europe some few families of fish now have aconfined range the teleostean fish might formerly have had a similarlyconfined range and after having been largely developed in some one sea might have spread widely nor have we any right to suppose that the seasof the world have always been so freely open from south to north asthey are at present even at this day if the malay archipelago wereconverted into land the tropical parts of the indian ocean would forma large and perfectly enclosed basin in which any great group of marineanimals might be multiplied and here they would remain confined untilsome of the species became adapted to a cooler climate and were enabledto double the southern capes of africa or australia and thus reachother and distant seas from these and similar considerations but chiefly from our ignoranceof the geology of other countries beyond the confines of europe and theunited states and from the revolution in our palaeontological ideason many points which the discoveries of even the last dozen years haveeffected it seems to me to be about as rash in us to dogmatize on thesuccession of organic beings throughout the world as it would be fora naturalist to land for five minutes on some one barren point inaustralia and then to discuss the number and range of its productions on the sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the lowest knownfossiliferous strata there is another and allied difficulty which is much graver i alludeto the manner in which numbers of species of the same group suddenlyappear in the lowest known fossiliferous rocks most of the argumentswhich have convinced me that all the existing species of the same grouphave descended from one progenitor apply with nearly equal force tothe earliest known species for instance i cannot doubt that all thesilurian trilobites have descended from some one crustacean which musthave lived long before the silurian age and which probably differedgreatly from any known animal some of the most ancient siluriananimals as the nautilus lingula etc do not differ much from livingspecies and it cannot on my theory be supposed that these old specieswere the progenitors of all the species of the orders to which theybelong for they do not present characters in any degree intermediatebetween them if moreover they had been the progenitors of theseorders they would almost certainly have been long ago supplanted andexterminated by their numerous and improved descendants consequently if my theory be true it is indisputable that before thelowest silurian stratum was deposited long periods elapsed as long as or probably far longer than the whole interval from the silurian age tothe present day and that during these vast yet quite unknown periodsof time the world swarmed with living creatures to the question why we do not find records of these vast primordialperiods i can give no satisfactory answer several of the most eminentgeologists with sir r murchison at their head are convinced that wesee in the organic remains of the lowest silurian stratum the dawn oflife on this planet other highly competent judges as lyell and thelate e forbes dispute this conclusion we should not forget that onlya small portion of the world is known with accuracy m barrande haslately added another and lower stage to the silurian system aboundingwith new and peculiar species traces of life have been detected in thelongmynd beds beneath barrande s so called primordial zone the presenceof phosphatic nodules and bituminous matter in some of the lowest azoicrocks probably indicates the former existence of life at these periods but the difficulty of understanding the absence of vast piles offossiliferous strata which on my theory no doubt were somewhereaccumulated before the silurian epoch is very great if these mostancient beds had been wholly worn away by denudation or obliteratedby metamorphic action we ought to find only small remnants of theformations next succeeding them in age and these ought to be verygenerally in a metamorphosed condition but the descriptions which wenow possess of the silurian deposits over immense territories inrussia and in north america do not support the view that the older aformation is the more it has suffered the extremity of denudation andmetamorphism the case at present must remain inexplicable and may be truly urged asa valid argument against the views here entertained to show that itmay hereafter receive some explanation i will give the followinghypothesis from the nature of the organic remains which do not appearto have inhabited profound depths in the several formations of europeand of the united states and from the amount of sediment miles inthickness of which the formations are composed we may infer that fromfirst to last large islands or tracts of land whence the sediment wasderived occurred in the neighbourhood of the existing continents ofeurope and north america but we do not know what was the state ofthings in the intervals between the successive formations whethereurope and the united states during these intervals existed as dryland or as a submarine surface near land on which sediment was notdeposited or again as the bed of an open and unfathomable sea looking to the existing oceans which are thrice as extensive as theland we see them studded with many islands but not one oceanic islandis as yet known to afford even a remnant of any palaeozoic or secondaryformation hence we may perhaps infer that during the palaeozoic andsecondary periods neither continents nor continental islands existedwhere our oceans now extend for had they existed there palaeozoic andsecondary formations would in all probability have been accumulated fromsediment derived from their wear and tear and would have been at leastpartially upheaved by the oscillations of level which we may fairlyconclude must have intervened during these enormously long periods ifthen we may infer anything from these facts we may infer that whereour oceans now extend oceans have extended from the remotest period ofwhich we have any record and on the other hand that where continentsnow exist large tracts of land have existed subjected no doubt togreat oscillations of level since the earliest silurian period thecoloured map appended to my volume on coral reefs led me to concludethat the great oceans are still mainly areas of subsidence the greatarchipelagoes still areas of oscillations of level and the continentsareas of elevation but have we any right to assume that things havethus remained from eternity our continents seem to have been formedby a preponderance during many oscillations of level of the force ofelevation but may not the areas of preponderant movement have changedin the lapse of ages at a period immeasurably antecedent to thesilurian epoch continents may have existed where oceans are now spreadout and clear and open oceans may have existed where our continents nowstand nor should we be justified in assuming that if for instance thebed of the pacific ocean were now converted into a continent we shouldthere find formations older than the silurian strata supposing such tohave been formerly deposited for it might well happen that strata whichhad subsided some miles nearer to the centre of the earth and whichhad been pressed on by an enormous weight of superincumbent water mighthave undergone far more metamorphic action than strata which have alwaysremained nearer to the surface the immense areas in some parts of theworld for instance in south america of bare metamorphic rocks whichmust have been heated under great pressure have always seemed to me torequire some special explanation and we may perhaps believe that we seein these large areas the many formations long anterior to the silurianepoch in a completely metamorphosed condition the several difficulties here discussed namely our not finding in thesuccessive formations infinitely numerous transitional links between themany species which now exist or have existed the sudden manner in whichwhole groups of species appear in our european formations the almostentire absence as at present known of fossiliferous formations beneaththe silurian strata are all undoubtedly of the gravest nature wesee this in the plainest manner by the fact that all the most eminentpalaeontologists namely cuvier owen agassiz barrande falconer e forbes etc and all our greatest geologists as lyell murchison sedgwick etc have unanimously often vehemently maintained theimmutability of species but i have reason to believe that one greatauthority sir charles lyell from further reflexion entertains gravedoubts on this subject i feel how rash it is to differ from these greatauthorities to whom with others we owe all our knowledge those whothink the natural geological record in any degree perfect and who donot attach much weight to the facts and arguments of other kinds givenin this volume will undoubtedly at once reject my theory for my part following out lyell s metaphor i look at the natural geological record as a history of the world imperfectly kept and written in a changingdialect of this history we possess the last volume alone relating onlyto two or three countries of this volume only here and there a shortchapter has been preserved and of each page only here and there a fewlines each word of the slowly changing language in which thehistory is supposed to be written being more or less different inthe interrupted succession of chapters may represent the apparentlyabruptly changed forms of life entombed in our consecutive but widelyseparated formations on this view the difficulties above discussed aregreatly diminished or even disappear on the geological succession of organic beings on the slow and successive appearance of new species on their differentrates of change species once lost do not reappear groups of speciesfollow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance asdo single species on extinction on simultaneous changes in the formsof life throughout the world on the affinities of extinct species toeach other and to living species on the state of development of ancientforms on the succession of the same types within the same areas summary of preceding and present chapters let us now see whether the several facts and rules relating to thegeological succession of organic beings better accord with the commonview of the immutability of species or with that of their slow andgradual modification through descent and natural selection new species have appeared very slowly one after another both on theland and in the waters lyell has shown that it is hardly possible toresist the evidence on this head in the case of the several tertiarystages and every year tends to fill up the blanks between them and tomake the percentage system of lost and new forms more gradual insome of the most recent beds though undoubtedly of high antiquity ifmeasured by years only one or two species are lost forms and only oneor two are new forms having here appeared for the first time eitherlocally or as far as we know on the face of the earth if we maytrust the observations of philippi in sicily the successive changes inthe marine inhabitants of that island have been many and most gradual the secondary formations are more broken but as bronn has remarked neither the appearance nor disappearance of their many now extinctspecies has been simultaneous in each separate formation species of different genera and classes have not changed at the samerate or in the same degree in the oldest tertiary beds a few livingshells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms falconer has given a striking instance of a similar fact in an existingcrocodile associated with many strange and lost mammals and reptiles inthe sub himalayan deposits the silurian lingula differs but little fromthe living species of this genus whereas most of the other silurianmolluscs and all the crustaceans have changed greatly the productionsof the land seem to change at a quicker rate than those of the sea ofwhich a striking instance has lately been observed in switzerland thereis some reason to believe that organisms considered high in the scaleof nature change more quickly than those that are low though thereare exceptions to this rule the amount of organic change as pictethas remarked does not strictly correspond with the succession of ourgeological formations so that between each two consecutive formations the forms of life have seldom changed in exactly the same degree yet ifwe compare any but the most closely related formations all the specieswill be found to have undergone some change when a species has oncedisappeared from the face of the earth we have reason to believethat the same identical form never reappears the strongest apparentexception to this latter rule is that of the so called colonies of m barrande which intrude for a period in the midst of an older formation and then allow the pre existing fauna to reappear but lyell sexplanation namely that it is a case of temporary migration from adistinct geographical province seems to me satisfactory these several facts accord well with my theory i believe in no fixedlaw of development causing all the inhabitants of a country to changeabruptly or simultaneously or to an equal degree the process ofmodification must be extremely slow the variability of each speciesis quite independent of that of all others whether such variability betaken advantage of by natural selection and whether the variations beaccumulated to a greater or lesser amount thus causing a greater orlesser amount of modification in the varying species depends on manycomplex contingencies on the variability being of a beneficial nature on the power of intercrossing on the rate of breeding on the slowlychanging physical conditions of the country and more especially on thenature of the other inhabitants with which the varying species comesinto competition hence it is by no means surprising that one speciesshould retain the same identical form much longer than others or if changing that it should change less we see the same fact ingeographical distribution for instance in the land shells andcoleopterous insects of madeira having come to differ considerably fromtheir nearest allies on the continent of europe whereas the marineshells and birds have remained unaltered we can perhaps understandthe apparently quicker rate of change in terrestrial and in more highlyorganised productions compared with marine and lower productions bythe more complex relations of the higher beings to their organic andinorganic conditions of life as explained in a former chapter whenmany of the inhabitants of a country have become modified and improved we can understand on the principle of competition and on that of themany all important relations of organism to organism that any formwhich does not become in some degree modified and improved will beliable to be exterminated hence we can see why all the species in thesame region do at last if we look to wide enough intervals of time become modified for those which do not change will become extinct in members of the same class the average amount of change during longand equal periods of time may perhaps be nearly the same but as theaccumulation of long enduring fossiliferous formations depends on greatmasses of sediment having been deposited on areas whilst subsiding our formations have been almost necessarily accumulated at wide andirregularly intermittent intervals consequently the amount of organicchange exhibited by the fossils embedded in consecutive formationsis not equal each formation on this view does not mark a new andcomplete act of creation but only an occasional scene taken almost athazard in a slowly changing drama we can clearly understand why a species when once lost should neverreappear even if the very same conditions of life organic andinorganic should recur for though the offspring of one species mightbe adapted and no doubt this has occurred in innumerable instances tofill the exact place of another species in the economy of nature andthus supplant it yet the two forms the old and the new would not beidentically the same for both would almost certainly inherit differentcharacters from their distinct progenitors for instance it is justpossible if our fantail pigeons were all destroyed that fanciers bystriving during long ages for the same object might make a new breedhardly distinguishable from our present fantail but if the parentrock pigeon were also destroyed and in nature we have every reasonto believe that the parent form will generally be supplanted andexterminated by its improved offspring it is quite incredible that afantail identical with the existing breed could be raised from anyother species of pigeon or even from the other well established racesof the domestic pigeon for the newly formed fantail would be almostsure to inherit from its new progenitor some slight characteristicdifferences groups of species that is genera and families follow the same generalrules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species changing more or less quickly and in a greater or lesser degree agroup does not reappear after it has once disappeared or its existence as long as it lasts is continuous i am aware that there are someapparent exceptions to this rule but the exceptions are surprisinglyfew so few that e forbes pictet and woodward though all stronglyopposed to such views as i maintain admit its truth and the rulestrictly accords with my theory for as all the species of the samegroup have descended from some one species it is clear that as long asany species of the group have appeared in the long succession of ages so long must its members have continuously existed in order to havegenerated either new and modified or the same old and unmodified forms species of the genus lingula for instance must have continuouslyexisted by an unbroken succession of generations from the lowestsilurian stratum to the present day we have seen in the last chapter that the species of a group sometimesfalsely appear to have come in abruptly and i have attempted to givean explanation of this fact which if true would have been fatal to myviews but such cases are certainly exceptional the general rule beinga gradual increase in number till the group reaches its maximum andthen sooner or later it gradually decreases if the number ofthe species of a genus or the number of the genera of a family berepresented by a vertical line of varying thickness crossing thesuccessive geological formations in which the species are found theline will sometimes falsely appear to begin at its lower end not in asharp point but abruptly it then gradually thickens upwards sometimeskeeping for a space of equal thickness and ultimately thins out in theupper beds marking the decrease and final extinction of the species this gradual increase in number of the species of a group is strictlyconformable with my theory as the species of the same genus and thegenera of the same family can increase only slowly and progressively for the process of modification and the production of a number of alliedforms must be slow and gradual one species giving rise first to twoor three varieties these being slowly converted into species which intheir turn produce by equally slow steps other species and so on likethe branching of a great tree from a single stem till the group becomeslarge on extinction we have as yet spoken only incidentally of the disappearance of speciesand of groups of species on the theory of natural selection theextinction of old forms and the production of new and improved forms areintimately connected together the old notion of all the inhabitants ofthe earth having been swept away at successive periods by catastrophes is very generally given up even by those geologists as elie debeaumont murchison barrande etc whose general views would naturallylead them to this conclusion on the contrary we have every reason tobelieve from the study of the tertiary formations that species andgroups of species gradually disappear one after another first from onespot then from another and finally from the world both single speciesand whole groups of species last for very unequal periods some groups as we have seen having endured from the earliest known dawn of lifeto the present day some having disappeared before the close of thepalaeozoic period no fixed law seems to determine the length of timeduring which any single species or any single genus endures there isreason to believe that the complete extinction of the species of a groupis generally a slower process than their production if the appearanceand disappearance of a group of species be represented as before bya vertical line of varying thickness the line is found to taper moregradually at its upper end which marks the progress of extermination than at its lower end which marks the first appearance and increasein numbers of the species in some cases however the exterminationof whole groups of beings as of ammonites towards the close of thesecondary period has been wonderfully sudden the whole subject of the extinction of species has been involved in themost gratuitous mystery some authors have even supposed that as theindividual has a definite length of life so have species a definiteduration no one i think can have marvelled more at the extinction ofspecies than i have done when i found in la plata the tooth of a horseembedded with the remains of mastodon megatherium toxodon and otherextinct monsters which all co existed with still living shells at avery late geological period i was filled with astonishment for seeingthat the horse since its introduction by the spaniards into southamerica has run wild over the whole country and has increased innumbers at an unparalleled rate i asked myself what could so recentlyhave exterminated the former horse under conditions of life apparentlyso favourable but how utterly groundless was my astonishment professorowen soon perceived that the tooth though so like that of the existinghorse belonged to an extinct species had this horse been stillliving but in some degree rare no naturalist would have felt the leastsurprise at its rarity for rarity is the attribute of a vast number ofspecies of all classes in all countries if we ask ourselves why thisor that species is rare we answer that something is unfavourable in itsconditions of life but what that something is we can hardly ever tell on the supposition of the fossil horse still existing as a rare species we might have felt certain from the analogy of all other mammals even of the slow breeding elephant and from the history of thenaturalisation of the domestic horse in south america that under morefavourable conditions it would in a very few years have stocked thewhole continent but we could not have told what the unfavourableconditions were which checked its increase whether some one or severalcontingencies and at what period of the horse s life and in whatdegree they severally acted if the conditions had gone on howeverslowly becoming less and less favourable we assuredly should not haveperceived the fact yet the fossil horse would certainly have becomerarer and rarer and finally extinct its place being seized on by somemore successful competitor it is most difficult always to remember that the increase of everyliving being is constantly being checked by unperceived injuriousagencies and that these same unperceived agencies are amply sufficientto cause rarity and finally extinction we see in many cases in themore recent tertiary formations that rarity precedes extinction and weknow that this has been the progress of events with those animals whichhave been exterminated either locally or wholly through man s agency i may repeat what i published in namely that to admit thatspecies generally become rare before they become extinct to feel nosurprise at the rarity of a species and yet to marvel greatly whenit ceases to exist is much the same as to admit that sickness in theindividual is the forerunner of death to feel no surprise at sickness but when the sick man dies to wonder and to suspect that he died bysome unknown deed of violence the theory of natural selection is grounded on the belief that each newvariety and ultimately each new species is produced and maintained byhaving some advantage over those with which it comes into competition and the consequent extinction of less favoured forms almost inevitablyfollows it is the same with our domestic productions when a new andslightly improved variety has been raised it at first supplants theless improved varieties in the same neighbourhood when much improved itis transported far and near like our short horn cattle and takes theplace of other breeds in other countries thus the appearance of newforms and the disappearance of old forms both natural and artificial are bound together in certain flourishing groups the number of newspecific forms which have been produced within a given time is probablygreater than that of the old forms which have been exterminated but weknow that the number of species has not gone on indefinitely increasing at least during the later geological periods so that looking to latertimes we may believe that the production of new forms has caused theextinction of about the same number of old forms the competition will generally be most severe as formerly explainedand illustrated by examples between the forms which are most like eachother in all respects hence the improved and modified descendants ofa species will generally cause the extermination of the parent species and if many new forms have been developed from any one species thenearest allies of that species i e the species of the same genus willbe the most liable to extermination thus as i believe a number ofnew species descended from one species that is a new genus comes tosupplant an old genus belonging to the same family but it must oftenhave happened that a new species belonging to some one group will haveseized on the place occupied by a species belonging to a distinct group and thus caused its extermination and if many allied forms be developedfrom the successful intruder many will have to yield their places andit will generally be allied forms which will suffer from some inheritedinferiority in common but whether it be species belonging to the sameor to a distinct class which yield their places to other species whichhave been modified and improved a few of the sufferers may often longbe preserved from being fitted to some peculiar line of life or frominhabiting some distant and isolated station where they have escapedsevere competition for instance a single species of trigonia a greatgenus of shells in the secondary formations survives in the australianseas and a few members of the great and almost extinct group of ganoidfishes still inhabit our fresh waters therefore the utter extinctionof a group is generally as we have seen a slower process than itsproduction with respect to the apparently sudden extermination of whole familiesor orders as of trilobites at the close of the palaeozoic period andof ammonites at the close of the secondary period we must remember whathas been already said on the probable wide intervals of time between ourconsecutive formations and in these intervals there may have been muchslow extermination moreover when by sudden immigration or by unusuallyrapid development many species of a new group have taken possessionof a new area they will have exterminated in a correspondingly rapidmanner many of the old inhabitants and the forms which thus yieldtheir places will commonly be allied for they will partake of someinferiority in common thus as it seems to me the manner in which single species and wholegroups of species become extinct accords well with the theory ofnatural selection we need not marvel at extinction if we mustmarvel let it be at our presumption in imagining for a moment that weunderstand the many complex contingencies on which the existence ofeach species depends if we forget for an instant that each speciestends to increase inordinately and that some check is always in action yet seldom perceived by us the whole economy of nature will be utterlyobscured whenever we can precisely say why this species is moreabundant in individuals than that why this species and not anothercan be naturalised in a given country then and not till then we mayjustly feel surprise why we cannot account for the extinction of thisparticular species or group of species on the forms of life changing almost simultaneously throughout theworld scarcely any palaeontological discovery is more striking than the fact that the forms of life change almost simultaneously throughout theworld thus our european chalk formation can be recognised in manydistant parts of the world under the most different climates where nota fragment of the mineral chalk itself can be found namely in northamerica in equatorial south america in tierra del fuego at thecape of good hope and in the peninsula of india for at these distantpoints the organic remains in certain beds present an unmistakeabledegree of resemblance to those of the chalk it is not that the samespecies are met with for in some cases not one species is identicallythe same but they belong to the same families genera and sectionsof genera and sometimes are similarly characterised in such triflingpoints as mere superficial sculpture moreover other forms which arenot found in the chalk of europe but which occur in the formationseither above or below are similarly absent at these distant points ofthe world in the several successive palaeozoic formations of russia western europe and north america a similar parallelism in the forms oflife has been observed by several authors so it is according to lyell with the several european and north american tertiary deposits evenif the few fossil species which are common to the old and new worlds bekept wholly out of view the general parallelism in the successive formsof life in the stages of the widely separated palaeozoic and tertiaryperiods would still be manifest and the several formations could beeasily correlated these observations however relate to the marine inhabitants of distantparts of the world we have not sufficient data to judge whether theproductions of the land and of fresh water change at distant points inthe same parallel manner we may doubt whether they have thus changed if the megatherium mylodon macrauchenia and toxodon had been broughtto europe from la plata without any information in regard to theirgeological position no one would have suspected that they had coexistedwith still living sea shells but as these anomalous monsters coexistedwith the mastodon and horse it might at least have been inferred thatthey had lived during one of the latter tertiary stages when the marine forms of life are spoken of as having changedsimultaneously throughout the world it must not be supposed that thisexpression relates to the same thousandth or hundred thousandth year oreven that it has a very strict geological sense for if all the marineanimals which live at the present day in europe and all those thatlived in europe during the pleistocene period an enormously remoteperiod as measured by years including the whole glacial epoch were tobe compared with those now living in south america or in australia themost skilful naturalist would hardly be able to say whether the existingor the pleistocene inhabitants of europe resembled most closely those ofthe southern hemisphere so again several highly competent observersbelieve that the existing productions of the united states are moreclosely related to those which lived in europe during certain latertertiary stages than to those which now live here and if this be so it is evident that fossiliferous beds deposited at the present day onthe shores of north america would hereafter be liable to be classed withsomewhat older european beds nevertheless looking to a remotely futureepoch there can i think be little doubt that all the more modernmarine formations namely the upper pliocene the pleistocene andstrictly modern beds of europe north and south america and australia from containing fossil remains in some degree allied and from notincluding those forms which are only found in the older underlyingdeposits would be correctly ranked as simultaneous in a geologicalsense the fact of the forms of life changing simultaneously in the abovelarge sense at distant parts of the world has greatly struck thoseadmirable observers mm de verneuil and d archiac after referringto the parallelism of the palaeozoic forms of life in various partsof europe they add if struck by this strange sequence we turn ourattention to north america and there discover a series of analogousphenomena it will appear certain that all these modifications ofspecies their extinction and the introduction of new ones cannot beowing to mere changes in marine currents or other causes more or lesslocal and temporary but depend on general laws which govern the wholeanimal kingdom m barrande has made forcible remarks to precisely thesame effect it is indeed quite futile to look to changes of currents climate or other physical conditions as the cause of these greatmutations in the forms of life throughout the world under the mostdifferent climates we must as barrande has remarked look to somespecial law we shall see this more clearly when we treat of the presentdistribution of organic beings and find how slight is the relationbetween the physical conditions of various countries and the nature oftheir inhabitants this great fact of the parallel succession of the forms of lifethroughout the world is explicable on the theory of natural selection new species are formed by new varieties arising which have someadvantage over older forms and those forms which are already dominant or have some advantage over the other forms in their own country wouldnaturally oftenest give rise to new varieties or incipient species forthese latter must be victorious in a still higher degree in order to bepreserved and to survive we have distinct evidence on this head inthe plants which are dominant that is which are commonest in their ownhomes and are most widely diffused having produced the greatest numberof new varieties it is also natural that the dominant varying andfar spreading species which already have invaded to a certain extentthe territories of other species should be those which would havethe best chance of spreading still further and of giving rise in newcountries to new varieties and species the process of diffusionmay often be very slow being dependent on climatal and geographicalchanges or on strange accidents but in the long run the dominantforms will generally succeed in spreading the diffusion would itis probable be slower with the terrestrial inhabitants of distinctcontinents than with the marine inhabitants of the continuous sea wemight therefore expect to find as we apparently do find a less strictdegree of parallel succession in the productions of the land than of thesea dominant species spreading from any region might encounter still moredominant species and then their triumphant course or even theirexistence would cease we know not at all precisely what are all theconditions most favourable for the multiplication of new and dominantspecies but we can i think clearly see that a number of individuals from giving a better chance of the appearance of favourable variations and that severe competition with many already existing forms wouldbe highly favourable as would be the power of spreading into newterritories a certain amount of isolation recurring at long intervalsof time would probably be also favourable as before explained onequarter of the world may have been most favourable for the productionof new and dominant species on the land and another for those in thewaters of the sea if two great regions had been for a long periodfavourably circumstanced in an equal degree whenever their inhabitantsmet the battle would be prolonged and severe and some from onebirthplace and some from the other might be victorious but in thecourse of time the forms dominant in the highest degree whereverproduced would tend everywhere to prevail as they prevailed theywould cause the extinction of other and inferior forms and as theseinferior forms would be allied in groups by inheritance whole groupswould tend slowly to disappear though here and there a single membermight long be enabled to survive thus as it seems to me the parallel and taken in a large sense simultaneous succession of the same forms of life throughout the world accords well with the principle of new species having been formed bydominant species spreading widely and varying the new species thusproduced being themselves dominant owing to inheritance and to havingalready had some advantage over their parents or over other species these again spreading varying and producing new species the formswhich are beaten and which yield their places to the new and victoriousforms will generally be allied in groups from inheriting someinferiority in common and therefore as new and improved groups spreadthroughout the world old groups will disappear from the world and thesuccession of forms in both ways will everywhere tend to correspond there is one other remark connected with this subject worth making ihave given my reasons for believing that all our greater fossiliferousformations were deposited during periods of subsidence and that blankintervals of vast duration occurred during the periods when the bed ofthe sea was either stationary or rising and likewise when sediment wasnot thrown down quickly enough to embed and preserve organic remains during these long and blank intervals i suppose that the inhabitantsof each region underwent a considerable amount of modification andextinction and that there was much migration from other parts of theworld as we have reason to believe that large areas are affected by thesame movement it is probable that strictly contemporaneous formationshave often been accumulated over very wide spaces in the same quarterof the world but we are far from having any right to conclude that thishas invariably been the case and that large areas have invariably beenaffected by the same movements when two formations have been depositedin two regions during nearly but not exactly the same period we shouldfind in both from the causes explained in the foregoing paragraphs thesame general succession in the forms of life but the species would notexactly correspond for there will have been a little more time inthe one region than in the other for modification extinction andimmigration i suspect that cases of this nature have occurred in europe mr prestwich in his admirable memoirs on the eocene deposits of englandand france is able to draw a close general parallelism between thesuccessive stages in the two countries but when he compares certainstages in england with those in france although he finds in both acurious accordance in the numbers of the species belonging to the samegenera yet the species themselves differ in a manner very difficultto account for considering the proximity of the two areas unless indeed it be assumed that an isthmus separated two seas inhabitedby distinct but contemporaneous faunas lyell has made similarobservations on some of the later tertiary formations barrande also shows that there is a striking general parallelism in the successivesilurian deposits of bohemia and scandinavia nevertheless he findsa surprising amount of difference in the species if the severalformations in these regions have not been deposited during the sameexact periods a formation in one region often corresponding with ablank interval in the other and if in both regions the specieshave gone on slowly changing during the accumulation of the severalformations and during the long intervals of time between them in thiscase the several formations in the two regions could be arranged inthe same order in accordance with the general succession of the formof life and the order would falsely appear to be strictly parallel nevertheless the species would not all be the same in the apparentlycorresponding stages in the two regions on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living forms let us now look to the mutual affinities of extinct and living species they all fall into one grand natural system and this fact is at onceexplained on the principle of descent the more ancient any form is themore as a general rule it differs from living forms but as bucklandlong ago remarked all fossils can be classed either in still existinggroups or between them that the extinct forms of life help to fill upthe wide intervals between existing genera families and orders cannotbe disputed for if we confine our attention either to the living orto the extinct alone the series is far less perfect than if we combineboth into one general system with respect to the vertebrata wholepages could be filled with striking illustrations from our greatpalaeontologist owen showing how extinct animals fall in betweenexisting groups cuvier ranked the ruminants and pachyderms as the twomost distinct orders of mammals but owen has discovered so many fossillinks that he has had to alter the whole classification of these twoorders and has placed certain pachyderms in the same sub order withruminants for example he dissolves by fine gradations the apparentlywide difference between the pig and the camel in regard to theinvertebrata barrande and a higher authority could not be named asserts that he is every day taught that palaeozoic animals thoughbelonging to the same orders families or genera with those living atthe present day were not at this early epoch limited in such distinctgroups as they now are some writers have objected to any extinct species or group of speciesbeing considered as intermediate between living species or groups if bythis term it is meant that an extinct form is directly intermediate inall its characters between two living forms the objection is probablyvalid but i apprehend that in a perfectly natural classification manyfossil species would have to stand between living species and someextinct genera between living genera even between genera belonging todistinct families the most common case especially with respect to verydistinct groups such as fish and reptiles seems to be that supposingthem to be distinguished at the present day from each other by adozen characters the ancient members of the same two groups would bedistinguished by a somewhat lesser number of characters so that the twogroups though formerly quite distinct at that period made some smallapproach to each other it is a common belief that the more ancient a form is by so much themore it tends to connect by some of its characters groups now widelyseparated from each other this remark no doubt must be restrictedto those groups which have undergone much change in the course ofgeological ages and it would be difficult to prove the truth ofthe proposition for every now and then even a living animal as thelepidosiren is discovered having affinities directed towards verydistinct groups yet if we compare the older reptiles and batrachians the older fish the older cephalopods and the eocene mammals with themore recent members of the same classes we must admit that there issome truth in the remark let us see how far these several facts and inferences accord with thetheory of descent with modification as the subject is somewhat complex i must request the reader to turn to the diagram in the fourth chapter we may suppose that the numbered letters represent genera and thedotted lines diverging from them the species in each genus the diagramis much too simple too few genera and too few species being given but this is unimportant for us the horizontal lines may representsuccessive geological formations and all the forms beneath theuppermost line may be considered as extinct the three existing genera a q p will form a small family b and f a closely alliedfamily or sub family and o e m a third family these threefamilies together with the many extinct genera on the several lines ofdescent diverging from the parent form a will form an order for allwill have inherited something in common from their ancient and commonprogenitor on the principle of the continued tendency to divergenceof character which was formerly illustrated by this diagram the morerecent any form is the more it will generally differ from its ancientprogenitor hence we can understand the rule that the most ancientfossils differ most from existing forms we must not however assumethat divergence of character is a necessary contingency it dependssolely on the descendants from a species being thus enabled to seizeon many and different places in the economy of nature therefore it isquite possible as we have seen in the case of some silurian forms that a species might go on being slightly modified in relation to itsslightly altered conditions of life and yet retain throughout a vastperiod the same general characteristics this is represented in thediagram by the letter f all the many forms extinct and recent descended from a make asbefore remarked one order and this order from the continued effectsof extinction and divergence of character has become divided intoseveral sub families and families some of which are supposed to haveperished at different periods and some to have endured to the presentday by looking at the diagram we can see that if many of the extinct forms supposed to be embedded in the successive formations were discoveredat several points low down in the series the three existing families onthe uppermost line would be rendered less distinct from each other if for instance the genera a a a f m m m were disinterred these three families would be so closely linked together that theyprobably would have to be united into one great family in nearly thesame manner as has occurred with ruminants and pachyderms yet he whoobjected to call the extinct genera which thus linked the livinggenera of three families together intermediate in character would bejustified as they are intermediate not directly but only by a longand circuitous course through many widely different forms if manyextinct forms were to be discovered above one of the middle horizontallines or geological formations for instance above number vi butnone from beneath this line then only the two families on the lefthand namely a etc and b etc would have to be united intoone family and the two other families namely a to f now includingfive genera and o to m would yet remain distinct these twofamilies however would be less distinct from each other than they werebefore the discovery of the fossils if for instance we suppose theexisting genera of the two families to differ from each other by a dozencharacters in this case the genera at the early period marked vi would differ by a lesser number of characters for at this earlystage of descent they have not diverged in character from the commonprogenitor of the order nearly so much as they subsequently diverged thus it comes that ancient and extinct genera are often in some slightdegree intermediate in character between their modified descendants orbetween their collateral relations in nature the case will be far more complicated than is represented inthe diagram for the groups will have been more numerous they willhave endured for extremely unequal lengths of time and will have beenmodified in various degrees as we possess only the last volume of thegeological record and that in a very broken condition we have no rightto expect except in very rare cases to fill up wide intervals in thenatural system and thus unite distinct families or orders all that wehave a right to expect is that those groups which have within knowngeological periods undergone much modification should in the olderformations make some slight approach to each other so that the oldermembers should differ less from each other in some of their charactersthan do the existing members of the same groups and this by theconcurrent evidence of our best palaeontologists seems frequently to bethe case thus on the theory of descent with modification the main facts withrespect to the mutual affinities of the extinct forms of life to eachother and to living forms seem to me explained in a satisfactorymanner and they are wholly inexplicable on any other view on this same theory it is evident that the fauna of any great periodin the earth s history will be intermediate in general character betweenthat which preceded and that which succeeded it thus the specieswhich lived at the sixth great stage of descent in the diagram are themodified offspring of those which lived at the fifth stage and are theparents of those which became still more modified at the seventh stage hence they could hardly fail to be nearly intermediate in characterbetween the forms of life above and below we must however allow forthe entire extinction of some preceding forms and for the coming in ofquite new forms by immigration and for a large amount of modification during the long and blank intervals between the successive formations subject to these allowances the fauna of each geological periodundoubtedly is intermediate in character between the preceding andsucceeding faunas i need give only one instance namely the mannerin which the fossils of the devonian system when this system was firstdiscovered were at once recognised by palaeontologists as intermediatein character between those of the overlying carboniferous andunderlying silurian system but each fauna is not necessarily exactlyintermediate as unequal intervals of time have elapsed betweenconsecutive formations it is no real objection to the truth of the statement that the fauna ofeach period as a whole is nearly intermediate in character between thepreceding and succeeding faunas that certain genera offer exceptionsto the rule for instance mastodons and elephants when arranged by dr falconer in two series first according to their mutual affinitiesand then according to their periods of existence do not accord inarrangement the species extreme in character are not the oldest orthe most recent nor are those which are intermediate in character intermediate in age but supposing for an instant in this and othersuch cases that the record of the first appearance and disappearanceof the species was perfect we have no reason to believe that formssuccessively produced necessarily endure for corresponding lengths oftime a very ancient form might occasionally last much longer thana form elsewhere subsequently produced especially in the case ofterrestrial productions inhabiting separated districts to compare smallthings with great if the principal living and extinct races of thedomestic pigeon were arranged as well as they could be in serialaffinity this arrangement would not closely accord with the orderin time of their production and still less with the order of theirdisappearance for the parent rock pigeon now lives and many varietiesbetween the rock pigeon and the carrier have become extinct andcarriers which are extreme in the important character of length of beakoriginated earlier than short beaked tumblers which are at the oppositeend of the series in this same respect closely connected with the statement that the organic remains from anintermediate formation are in some degree intermediate in character is the fact insisted on by all palaeontologists that fossils from twoconsecutive formations are far more closely related to each other thanare the fossils from two remote formations pictet gives as a well knowninstance the general resemblance of the organic remains from theseveral stages of the chalk formation though the species are distinctin each stage this fact alone from its generality seems to haveshaken professor pictet in his firm belief in the immutability ofspecies he who is acquainted with the distribution of existing speciesover the globe will not attempt to account for the close resemblance ofthe distinct species in closely consecutive formations by the physicalconditions of the ancient areas having remained nearly the same let itbe remembered that the forms of life at least those inhabiting the sea have changed almost simultaneously throughout the world and thereforeunder the most different climates and conditions consider theprodigious vicissitudes of climate during the pleistocene period whichincludes the whole glacial period and note how little the specificforms of the inhabitants of the sea have been affected on the theory of descent the full meaning of the fact of fossil remainsfrom closely consecutive formations though ranked as distinct species being closely related is obvious as the accumulation of each formationhas often been interrupted and as long blank intervals have intervenedbetween successive formations we ought not to expect to find as iattempted to show in the last chapter in any one or two formations allthe intermediate varieties between the species which appeared at thecommencement and close of these periods but we ought to find afterintervals very long as measured by years but only moderately longas measured geologically closely allied forms or as they have beencalled by some authors representative species and these we assuredlydo find we find in short such evidence of the slow and scarcelysensible mutation of specific forms as we have a just right to expectto find on the state of development of ancient forms there has been much discussion whether recent forms are more highlydeveloped than ancient i will not here enter on this subject fornaturalists have not as yet defined to each other s satisfaction what ismeant by high and low forms but in one particular sense the more recentforms must on my theory be higher than the more ancient for each newspecies is formed by having had some advantage in the struggle for lifeover other and preceding forms if under a nearly similar climate theeocene inhabitants of one quarter of the world were put into competitionwith the existing inhabitants of the same or some other quarter theeocene fauna or flora would certainly be beaten and exterminated as would a secondary fauna by an eocene and a palaeozoic fauna by asecondary fauna i do not doubt that this process of improvement hasaffected in a marked and sensible manner the organisation of the morerecent and victorious forms of life in comparison with the ancient andbeaten forms but i can see no way of testing this sort of progress crustaceans for instance not the highest in their own class may havebeaten the highest molluscs from the extraordinary manner in whicheuropean productions have recently spread over new zealand and haveseized on places which must have been previously occupied we maybelieve if all the animals and plants of great britain were set freein new zealand that in the course of time a multitude of british formswould become thoroughly naturalized there and would exterminate manyof the natives on the other hand from what we see now occurring in newzealand and from hardly a single inhabitant of the southern hemispherehaving become wild in any part of europe we may doubt if all theproductions of new zealand were set free in great britain whether anyconsiderable number would be enabled to seize on places now occupied byour native plants and animals under this point of view the productionsof great britain may be said to be higher than those of new zealand yetthe most skilful naturalist from an examination of the species of thetwo countries could not have foreseen this result agassiz insists that ancient animals resemble to a certain extent theembryos of recent animals of the same classes or that the geologicalsuccession of extinct forms is in some degree parallel to theembryological development of recent forms i must follow pictet andhuxley in thinking that the truth of this doctrine is very far fromproved yet i fully expect to see it hereafter confirmed at least inregard to subordinate groups which have branched off from each otherwithin comparatively recent times for this doctrine of agassiz accordswell with the theory of natural selection in a future chapter ishall attempt to show that the adult differs from its embryo owingto variations supervening at a not early age and being inherited ata corresponding age this process whilst it leaves the embryo almostunaltered continually adds in the course of successive generations more and more difference to the adult thus the embryo comes to be left as a sort of picture preserved bynature of the ancient and less modified condition of each animal thisview may be true and yet it may never be capable of full proof seeing for instance that the oldest known mammals reptiles and fish strictlybelong to their own proper classes though some of these old forms arein a slight degree less distinct from each other than are the typicalmembers of the same groups at the present day it would be vain to lookfor animals having the common embryological character of the vertebrata until beds far beneath the lowest silurian strata are discovered adiscovery of which the chance is very small on the succession of the same types within the same areas during thelater tertiary periods mr clift many years ago showed that the fossil mammals from theaustralian caves were closely allied to the living marsupials of thatcontinent in south america a similar relationship is manifest evento an uneducated eye in the gigantic pieces of armour like those of thearmadillo found in several parts of la plata and professor owen hasshown in the most striking manner that most of the fossil mammals buried there in such numbers are related to south american types thisrelationship is even more clearly seen in the wonderful collection offossil bones made by mm lund and clausen in the caves of brazil i wasso much impressed with these facts that i strongly insisted in and on this law of the succession of types on this wonderfulrelationship in the same continent between the dead and the living professor owen has subsequently extended the same generalisation tothe mammals of the old world we see the same law in this author srestorations of the extinct and gigantic birds of new zealand we seeit also in the birds of the caves of brazil mr woodward has shown thatthe same law holds good with sea shells but from the wide distributionof most genera of molluscs it is not well displayed by them othercases could be added as the relation between the extinct andliving land shells of madeira and between the extinct and livingbrackish water shells of the aralo caspian sea now what does this remarkable law of the succession of the same typeswithin the same areas mean he would be a bold man who after comparingthe present climate of australia and of parts of south america under thesame latitude would attempt to account on the one hand by dissimilarphysical conditions for the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of thesetwo continents and on the other hand by similarity of conditions for the uniformity of the same types in each during the later tertiaryperiods nor can it be pretended that it is an immutable law thatmarsupials should have been chiefly or solely produced in australia orthat edentata and other american types should have been solely producedin south america for we know that europe in ancient times was peopledby numerous marsupials and i have shown in the publications abovealluded to that in america the law of distribution of terrestrialmammals was formerly different from what it now is north americaformerly partook strongly of the present character of the southernhalf of the continent and the southern half was formerly more closelyallied than it is at present to the northern half in a similar mannerwe know from falconer and cautley s discoveries that northern india wasformerly more closely related in its mammals to africa than it is atthe present time analogous facts could be given in relation to thedistribution of marine animals on the theory of descent with modification the great law of the longenduring but not immutable succession of the same types within thesame areas is at once explained for the inhabitants of each quarter ofthe world will obviously tend to leave in that quarter during the nextsucceeding period of time closely allied though in some degree modifieddescendants if the inhabitants of one continent formerly differedgreatly from those of another continent so will their modifieddescendants still differ in nearly the same manner and degree butafter very long intervals of time and after great geographical changes permitting much inter migration the feebler will yield to the moredominant forms and there will be nothing immutable in the laws of pastand present distribution it may be asked in ridicule whether i suppose that the megatherium andother allied huge monsters have left behind them in south america thesloth armadillo and anteater as their degenerate descendants thiscannot for an instant be admitted these huge animals have become whollyextinct and have left no progeny but in the caves of brazil thereare many extinct species which are closely allied in size and in othercharacters to the species still living in south america and some ofthese fossils may be the actual progenitors of living species it mustnot be forgotten that on my theory all the species of the same genushave descended from some one species so that if six genera each havingeight species be found in one geological formation and in the nextsucceeding formation there be six other allied or representative generawith the same number of species then we may conclude that only onespecies of each of the six older genera has left modified descendants constituting the six new genera the other seven species of the oldgenera have all died out and have left no progeny or which wouldprobably be a far commoner case two or three species of two or threealone of the six older genera will have been the parents of the six newgenera the other old species and the other whole genera havingbecome utterly extinct in failing orders with the genera and speciesdecreasing in numbers as apparently is the case of the edentata ofsouth america still fewer genera and species will have left modifiedblood descendants summary of the preceding and present chapters i have attempted to show that the geological record is extremelyimperfect that only a small portion of the globe has been geologicallyexplored with care that only certain classes of organic beings havebeen largely preserved in a fossil state that the number both ofspecimens and of species preserved in our museums is absolutely asnothing compared with the incalculable number of generations whichmust have passed away even during a single formation that owingto subsidence being necessary for the accumulation of fossiliferousdeposits thick enough to resist future degradation enormous intervalsof time have elapsed between the successive formations that there hasprobably been more extinction during the periods of subsidence and morevariation during the periods of elevation and during the latter therecord will have been least perfectly kept that each single formationhas not been continuously deposited that the duration of each formationis perhaps short compared with the average duration of specific forms that migration has played an important part in the first appearance ofnew forms in any one area and formation that widely ranging speciesare those which have varied most and have oftenest given rise to newspecies and that varieties have at first often been local all thesecauses taken conjointly must have tended to make the geological recordextremely imperfect and will to a large extent explain why we do notfind interminable varieties connecting together all the extinct andexisting forms of life by the finest graduated steps he who rejects these views on the nature of the geological record willrightly reject my whole theory for he may ask in vain where are thenumberless transitional links which must formerly have connected theclosely allied or representative species found in the several stages ofthe same great formation he may disbelieve in the enormous intervalsof time which have elapsed between our consecutive formations he mayoverlook how important a part migration must have played when theformations of any one great region alone as that of europe areconsidered he may urge the apparent but often falsely apparent suddencoming in of whole groups of species he may ask where are the remainsof those infinitely numerous organisms which must have existed longbefore the first bed of the silurian system was deposited i can answerthis latter question only hypothetically by saying that as far as wecan see where our oceans now extend they have for an enormous periodextended and where our oscillating continents now stand they have stoodever since the silurian epoch but that long before that period theworld may have presented a wholly different aspect and that the oldercontinents formed of formations older than any known to us may now allbe in a metamorphosed condition or may lie buried under the ocean passing from these difficulties all the other great leading facts inpalaeontology seem to me simply to follow on the theory of descent withmodification through natural selection we can thus understand how itis that new species come in slowly and successively how species ofdifferent classes do not necessarily change together or at the samerate or in the same degree yet in the long run that all undergomodification to some extent the extinction of old forms is the almostinevitable consequence of the production of new forms we can understandwhy when a species has once disappeared it never reappears groups ofspecies increase in numbers slowly and endure for unequal periods oftime for the process of modification is necessarily slow and dependson many complex contingencies the dominant species of the largerdominant groups tend to leave many modified descendants and thus newsub groups and groups are formed as these are formed the species ofthe less vigorous groups from their inferiority inherited from a commonprogenitor tend to become extinct together and to leave no modifiedoffspring on the face of the earth but the utter extinction of a wholegroup of species may often be a very slow process from the survival ofa few descendants lingering in protected and isolated situations whena group has once wholly disappeared it does not reappear for the linkof generation has been broken we can understand how the spreading of the dominant forms of life whichare those that oftenest vary will in the long run tend to people theworld with allied but modified descendants and these will generallysucceed in taking the places of those groups of species which are theirinferiors in the struggle for existence hence after long intervalsof time the productions of the world will appear to have changedsimultaneously we can understand how it is that all the forms of life ancient andrecent make together one grand system for all are connected bygeneration we can understand from the continued tendency to divergenceof character why the more ancient a form is the more it generallydiffers from those now living why ancient and extinct forms often tendto fill up gaps between existing forms sometimes blending two groupspreviously classed as distinct into one but more commonly only bringingthem a little closer together the more ancient a form is the moreoften apparently it displays characters in some degree intermediatebetween groups now distinct for the more ancient a form is the morenearly it will be related to and consequently resemble the commonprogenitor of groups since become widely divergent extinct formsare seldom directly intermediate between existing forms but areintermediate only by a long and circuitous course through many extinctand very different forms we can clearly see why the organic remains ofclosely consecutive formations are more closely allied to each other than are those of remote formations for the forms are more closelylinked together by generation we can clearly see why the remains of anintermediate formation are intermediate in character the inhabitants of each successive period in the world s history havebeaten their predecessors in the race for life and are in so far higher in the scale of nature and this may account for that vague yetill defined sentiment felt by many palaeontologists that organisationon the whole has progressed if it should hereafter be proved thatancient animals resemble to a certain extent the embryos of more recentanimals of the same class the fact will be intelligible the successionof the same types of structure within the same areas during the latergeological periods ceases to be mysterious and is simply explained byinheritance if then the geological record be as imperfect as i believe it to be andit may at least be asserted that the record cannot be proved to be muchmore perfect the main objections to the theory of natural selection aregreatly diminished or disappear on the other hand all the chief lawsof palaeontology plainly proclaim as it seems to me that species havebeen produced by ordinary generation old forms having been supplantedby new and improved forms of life produced by the laws of variationstill acting round us and preserved by natural selection geographical distribution present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physicalconditions importance of barriers affinity of the productions of thesame continent centres of creation means of dispersal by changes ofclimate and of the level of the land and by occasional means dispersalduring the glacial period co extensive with the world in considering the distribution of organic beings over the face ofthe globe the first great fact which strikes us is that neither thesimilarity nor the dissimilarity of the inhabitants of various regionscan be accounted for by their climatal and other physical conditions oflate almost every author who has studied the subject has come to thisconclusion the case of america alone would almost suffice to prove itstruth for if we exclude the northern parts where the circumpolar landis almost continuous all authors agree that one of the most fundamentaldivisions in geographical distribution is that between the new and oldworlds yet if we travel over the vast american continent from thecentral parts of the united states to its extreme southern point wemeet with the most diversified conditions the most humid districts arid deserts lofty mountains grassy plains forests marshes lakes and great rivers under almost every temperature there is hardly aclimate or condition in the old world which cannot be paralleled in thenew at least as closely as the same species generally require for itis a most rare case to find a group of organisms confined to any smallspot having conditions peculiar in only a slight degree for instance small areas in the old world could be pointed out hotter than any inthe new world yet these are not inhabited by a peculiar fauna or flora notwithstanding this parallelism in the conditions of the old and newworlds how widely different are their living productions in the southern hemisphere if we compare large tracts of land inaustralia south africa and western south america between latitudes deg and deg we shall find parts extremely similar in all theirconditions yet it would not be possible to point out three faunas andfloras more utterly dissimilar or again we may compare the productionsof south america south of lat deg with those north of deg whichconsequently inhabit a considerably different climate and they will befound incomparably more closely related to each other than they are tothe productions of australia or africa under nearly the same climate analogous facts could be given with respect to the inhabitants of thesea a second great fact which strikes us in our general review is thatbarriers of any kind or obstacles to free migration are related in aclose and important manner to the differences between the productions ofvarious regions we see this in the great difference of nearly all theterrestrial productions of the new and old worlds excepting in thenorthern parts where the land almost joins and where under a slightlydifferent climate there might have been free migration for the northerntemperate forms as there now is for the strictly arctic productions we see the same fact in the great difference between the inhabitants ofaustralia africa and south america under the same latitude for thesecountries are almost as much isolated from each other as is possible oneach continent also we see the same fact for on the opposite sidesof lofty and continuous mountain ranges and of great deserts andsometimes even of large rivers we find different productions though asmountain chains deserts etc are not as impassable or likely to haveendured so long as the oceans separating continents the differences arevery inferior in degree to those characteristic of distinct continents turning to the sea we find the same law no two marine faunas are moredistinct with hardly a fish shell or crab in common than those ofthe eastern and western shores of south and central america yet thesegreat faunas are separated only by the narrow but impassable isthmusof panama westward of the shores of america a wide space of open oceanextends with not an island as a halting place for emigrants here wehave a barrier of another kind and as soon as this is passed we meetin the eastern islands of the pacific with another and totallydistinct fauna so that here three marine faunas range far northwardand southward in parallel lines not far from each other undercorresponding climates but from being separated from each otherby impassable barriers either of land or open sea they are whollydistinct on the other hand proceeding still further westward from theeastern islands of the tropical parts of the pacific we encounter noimpassable barriers and we have innumerable islands as halting places until after travelling over a hemisphere we come to the shores ofafrica and over this vast space we meet with no well defined anddistinct marine faunas although hardly one shell crab or fish iscommon to the above named three approximate faunas of eastern andwestern america and the eastern pacific islands yet many fish rangefrom the pacific into the indian ocean and many shells are common tothe eastern islands of the pacific and the eastern shores of africa onalmost exactly opposite meridians of longitude a third great fact partly included in the foregoing statements is theaffinity of the productions of the same continent or sea though thespecies themselves are distinct at different points and stations it isa law of the widest generality and every continent offers innumerableinstances nevertheless the naturalist in travelling for instance from north to south never fails to be struck by the manner in whichsuccessive groups of beings specifically distinct yet clearly related replace each other he hears from closely allied yet distinct kinds ofbirds notes nearly similar and sees their nests similarly constructed but not quite alike with eggs coloured in nearly the same manner theplains near the straits of magellan are inhabited by one species ofrhea american ostrich and northward the plains of la plata by anotherspecies of the same genus and not by a true ostrich or emeu like thosefound in africa and australia under the same latitude on these sameplains of la plata we see the agouti and bizcacha animals havingnearly the same habits as our hares and rabbits and belonging to thesame order of rodents but they plainly display an american type ofstructure we ascend the lofty peaks of the cordillera and we find analpine species of bizcacha we look to the waters and we do not findthe beaver or musk rat but the coypu and capybara rodents of theamerican type innumerable other instances could be given if we lookto the islands off the american shore however much they may differ ingeological structure the inhabitants though they may be all peculiarspecies are essentially american we may look back to past ages asshown in the last chapter and we find american types then prevalent onthe american continent and in the american seas we see in these factssome deep organic bond prevailing throughout space and time overthe same areas of land and water and independent of their physicalconditions the naturalist must feel little curiosity who is not led toinquire what this bond is this bond on my theory is simply inheritance that cause which alone as far as we positively know produces organisms quite like or as wesee in the case of varieties nearly like each other the dissimilarityof the inhabitants of different regions may be attributed tomodification through natural selection and in a quite subordinatedegree to the direct influence of different physical conditions the degree of dissimilarity will depend on the migration of the moredominant forms of life from one region into another having been effectedwith more or less ease at periods more or less remote on the natureand number of the former immigrants and on their action and reaction in their mutual struggles for life the relation of organism toorganism being as i have already often remarked the most important ofall relations thus the high importance of barriers comes into play bychecking migration as does time for the slow process of modificationthrough natural selection widely ranging species abounding inindividuals which have already triumphed over many competitors in theirown widely extended homes will have the best chance of seizing on newplaces when they spread into new countries in their new homes theywill be exposed to new conditions and will frequently undergo furthermodification and improvement and thus they will become still furthervictorious and will produce groups of modified descendants on thisprinciple of inheritance with modification we can understand how it isthat sections of genera whole genera and even families are confined tothe same areas as is so commonly and notoriously the case i believe as was remarked in the last chapter in no law of necessarydevelopment as the variability of each species is an independentproperty and will be taken advantage of by natural selection only sofar as it profits the individual in its complex struggle for life so the degree of modification in different species will be no uniformquantity if for instance a number of species which stand in directcompetition with each other migrate in a body into a new and afterwardsisolated country they will be little liable to modification forneither migration nor isolation in themselves can do anything theseprinciples come into play only by bringing organisms into new relationswith each other and in a lesser degree with the surrounding physicalconditions as we have seen in the last chapter that some forms haveretained nearly the same character from an enormously remote geologicalperiod so certain species have migrated over vast spaces and have notbecome greatly modified on these views it is obvious that the several species of the samegenus though inhabiting the most distant quarters of the world mustoriginally have proceeded from the same source as they have descendedfrom the same progenitor in the case of those species which haveundergone during whole geological periods but little modification thereis not much difficulty in believing that they may have migrated from thesame region for during the vast geographical and climatal changes whichwill have supervened since ancient times almost any amount of migrationis possible but in many other cases in which we have reason to believethat the species of a genus have been produced within comparativelyrecent times there is great difficulty on this head it is also obviousthat the individuals of the same species though now inhabiting distantand isolated regions must have proceeded from one spot where theirparents were first produced for as explained in the last chapter itis incredible that individuals identically the same should ever havebeen produced through natural selection from parents specificallydistinct we are thus brought to the question which has been largely discussed bynaturalists namely whether species have been created at one or morepoints of the earth s surface undoubtedly there are very many cases ofextreme difficulty in understanding how the same species could possiblyhave migrated from some one point to the several distant and isolatedpoints where now found nevertheless the simplicity of the view thateach species was first produced within a single region captivates themind he who rejects it rejects the vera causa of ordinary generationwith subsequent migration and calls in the agency of a miracle it isuniversally admitted that in most cases the area inhabited by a speciesis continuous and when a plant or animal inhabits two points so distantfrom each other or with an interval of such a nature that the spacecould not be easily passed over by migration the fact is given assomething remarkable and exceptional the capacity of migrating acrossthe sea is more distinctly limited in terrestrial mammals than perhapsin any other organic beings and accordingly we find no inexplicablecases of the same mammal inhabiting distant points of the world nogeologist will feel any difficulty in such cases as great britain havingbeen formerly united to europe and consequently possessing the samequadrupeds but if the same species can be produced at two separatepoints why do we not find a single mammal common to europe andaustralia or south america the conditions of life are nearly thesame so that a multitude of european animals and plants have becomenaturalised in america and australia and some of the aboriginal plantsare identically the same at these distant points of the northern andsouthern hemispheres the answer as i believe is that mammals havenot been able to migrate whereas some plants from their varied meansof dispersal have migrated across the vast and broken interspace thegreat and striking influence which barriers of every kind have had ondistribution is intelligible only on the view that the great majorityof species have been produced on one side alone and have not been ableto migrate to the other side some few families many sub families very many genera and a still greater number of sections of generaare confined to a single region and it has been observed by severalnaturalists that the most natural genera or those genera in which thespecies are most closely related to each other are generally local or confined to one area what a strange anomaly it would be if whencoming one step lower in the series to the individuals of the samespecies a directly opposite rule prevailed and species were not local but had been produced in two or more distinct areas hence it seems to me as it has to many other naturalists that theview of each species having been produced in one area alone and havingsubsequently migrated from that area as far as its powers of migrationand subsistence under past and present conditions permitted is the mostprobable undoubtedly many cases occur in which we cannot explain howthe same species could have passed from one point to the other but thegeographical and climatal changes which have certainly occurred withinrecent geological times must have interrupted or rendered discontinuousthe formerly continuous range of many species so that we are reduced toconsider whether the exceptions to continuity of range are so numerousand of so grave a nature that we ought to give up the belief renderedprobable by general considerations that each species has been producedwithin one area and has migrated thence as far as it could it wouldbe hopelessly tedious to discuss all the exceptional cases of the samespecies now living at distant and separated points nor do i for amoment pretend that any explanation could be offered of many such cases but after some preliminary remarks i will discuss a few of the moststriking classes of facts namely the existence of the same specieson the summits of distant mountain ranges and at distant points in thearctic and antarctic regions and secondly in the following chapter the wide distribution of freshwater productions and thirdly theoccurrence of the same terrestrial species on islands and on themainland though separated by hundreds of miles of open sea if theexistence of the same species at distant and isolated points of theearth s surface can in many instances be explained on the view of eachspecies having migrated from a single birthplace then considering ourignorance with respect to former climatal and geographical changes andvarious occasional means of transport the belief that this has been theuniversal law seems to me incomparably the safest in discussing this subject we shall be enabled at the same time toconsider a point equally important for us namely whether the severaldistinct species of a genus which on my theory have all descended froma common progenitor can have migrated undergoing modificationduring some part of their migration from the area inhabited by theirprogenitor if it can be shown to be almost invariably the case thata region of which most of its inhabitants are closely related to or belong to the same genera with the species of a second region hasprobably received at some former period immigrants from this otherregion my theory will be strengthened for we can clearly understand on the principle of modification why the inhabitants of a region shouldbe related to those of another region whence it has been stocked avolcanic island for instance upheaved and formed at the distance of afew hundreds of miles from a continent would probably receive from itin the course of time a few colonists and their descendants thoughmodified would still be plainly related by inheritance to theinhabitants of the continent cases of this nature are common and are as we shall hereafter more fully see inexplicable on the theory ofindependent creation this view of the relation of species in one regionto those in another does not differ much by substituting the wordvariety for species from that lately advanced in an ingenious paper bymr wallace in which he concludes that every species has come intoexistence coincident both in space and time with a pre existingclosely allied species and i now know from correspondence that thiscoincidence he attributes to generation with modification the previous remarks on single and multiple centres of creation donot directly bear on another allied question namely whether all theindividuals of the same species have descended from a single pair orsingle hermaphrodite or whether as some authors suppose from manyindividuals simultaneously created with those organic beings whichnever intercross if such exist the species on my theory must havedescended from a succession of improved varieties which will never haveblended with other individuals or varieties but will have supplantedeach other so that at each successive stage of modification andimprovement all the individuals of each variety will have descendedfrom a single parent but in the majority of cases namely withall organisms which habitually unite for each birth or which oftenintercross i believe that during the slow process of modificationthe individuals of the species will have been kept nearly uniform byintercrossing so that many individuals will have gone on simultaneouslychanging and the whole amount of modification will not have been due at each stage to descent from a single parent to illustrate what imean our english racehorses differ slightly from the horses of everyother breed but they do not owe their difference and superiority todescent from any single pair but to continued care in selecting andtraining many individuals during many generations before discussing the three classes of facts which i have selected aspresenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the theory of singlecentres of creation i must say a few words on the means of dispersal means of dispersal sir c lyell and other authors have ably treated this subject i cangive here only the briefest abstract of the more important facts changeof climate must have had a powerful influence on migration a regionwhen its climate was different may have been a high road for migration but now be impassable i shall however presently have to discuss thisbranch of the subject in some detail changes of level in the land mustalso have been highly influential a narrow isthmus now separates twomarine faunas submerge it or let it formerly have been submerged andthe two faunas will now blend or may formerly have blended where thesea now extends land may at a former period have connected islands orpossibly even continents together and thus have allowed terrestrialproductions to pass from one to the other no geologist will disputethat great mutations of level have occurred within the period ofexisting organisms edward forbes insisted that all the islands in theatlantic must recently have been connected with europe or africa andeurope likewise with america other authors have thus hypotheticallybridged over every ocean and have united almost every island to somemainland if indeed the arguments used by forbes are to be trusted it must be admitted that scarcely a single island exists which has notrecently been united to some continent this view cuts the gordian knotof the dispersal of the same species to the most distant points andremoves many a difficulty but to the best of my judgment we are notauthorized in admitting such enormous geographical changes withinthe period of existing species it seems to me that we have abundantevidence of great oscillations of level in our continents but not ofsuch vast changes in their position and extension as to have unitedthem within the recent period to each other and to the severalintervening oceanic islands i freely admit the former existence of manyislands now buried beneath the sea which may have served as haltingplaces for plants and for many animals during their migration in thecoral producing oceans such sunken islands are now marked as i believe by rings of coral or atolls standing over them whenever it is fullyadmitted as i believe it will some day be that each species hasproceeded from a single birthplace and when in the course of time weknow something definite about the means of distribution we shall beenabled to speculate with security on the former extension of the land but i do not believe that it will ever be proved that within the recentperiod continents which are now quite separate have been continuously or almost continuously united with each other and with the manyexisting oceanic islands several facts in distribution such as thegreat difference in the marine faunas on the opposite sides of almostevery continent the close relation of the tertiary inhabitants ofseveral lands and even seas to their present inhabitants a certaindegree of relation as we shall hereafter see between the distributionof mammals and the depth of the sea these and other such facts seem tome opposed to the admission of such prodigious geographical revolutionswithin the recent period as are necessitated on the view advancedby forbes and admitted by his many followers the nature and relativeproportions of the inhabitants of oceanic islands likewise seem to meopposed to the belief of their former continuity with continents nordoes their almost universally volcanic composition favour the admissionthat they are the wrecks of sunken continents if they had originallyexisted as mountain ranges on the land some at least of the islandswould have been formed like other mountain summits of granite metamorphic schists old fossiliferous or other such rocks instead ofconsisting of mere piles of volcanic matter i must now say a few words on what are called accidental means butwhich more properly might be called occasional means of distribution i shall here confine myself to plants in botanical works this orthat plant is stated to be ill adapted for wide dissemination but fortransport across the sea the greater or less facilities may be said tobe almost wholly unknown until i tried with mr berkeley s aid afew experiments it was not even known how far seeds could resist theinjurious action of sea water to my surprise i found that out of kinds germinated after an immersion of days and a few survivedan immersion of days for convenience sake i chiefly tried smallseeds without the capsule or fruit and as all of these sank in a fewdays they could not be floated across wide spaces of the sea whetheror not they were injured by the salt water afterwards i tried somelarger fruits capsules etc and some of these floated for a longtime it is well known what a difference there is in the buoyancy ofgreen and seasoned timber and it occurred to me that floods might washdown plants or branches and that these might be dried on the banks andthen by a fresh rise in the stream be washed into the sea hence i wasled to dry stems and branches of plants with ripe fruit and to placethem on sea water the majority sank quickly but some which whilstgreen floated for a very short time when dried floated much longer forinstance ripe hazel nuts sank immediately but when dried they floatedfor days and afterwards when planted they germinated an asparagusplant with ripe berries floated for days when dried it floatedfor days and the seeds afterwards germinated the ripe seeds ofhelosciadium sank in two days when dried they floated for above days and afterwards germinated altogether out of the dried plants floated for above days and some of the floated for a very muchlonger period so that as seeds germinated after an immersionof days and as plants with ripe fruit but not all the samespecies as in the foregoing experiment floated after being dried forabove days as far as we may infer anything from these scanty facts we may conclude that the seeds of plants of any country might befloated by sea currents during days and would retain their powerof germination in johnston s physical atlas the average rate of theseveral atlantic currents is miles per diem some currents runningat the rate of miles per diem on this average the seeds of plants belonging to one country might be floated across miles of seato another country and when stranded if blown to a favourable spot byan inland gale they would germinate subsequently to my experiments m martens tried similar ones but in amuch better manner for he placed the seeds in a box in the actual sea so that they were alternately wet and exposed to the air like reallyfloating plants he tried seeds mostly different from mine but hechose many large fruits and likewise seeds from plants which livenear the sea and this would have favoured the average length oftheir flotation and of their resistance to the injurious action of thesalt water on the other hand he did not previously dry the plants orbranches with the fruit and this as we have seen would have causedsome of them to have floated much longer the result was that ofhis seeds floated for days and were then capable of germination buti do not doubt that plants exposed to the waves would float for a lesstime than those protected from violent movement as in our experiments therefore it would perhaps be safer to assume that the seeds of about plants of a flora after having been dried could be floatedacross a space of sea miles in width and would then germinate the fact of the larger fruits often floating longer than the small is interesting as plants with large seeds or fruit could hardly betransported by any other means and alph de candolle has shown thatsuch plants generally have restricted ranges but seeds may be occasionally transported in another manner drifttimber is thrown up on most islands even on those in the midst of thewidest oceans and the natives of the coral islands in the pacific procure stones for their tools solely from the roots of drifted trees these stones being a valuable royal tax i find on examination thatwhen irregularly shaped stones are embedded in the roots of trees smallparcels of earth are very frequently enclosed in their interstices andbehind them so perfectly that not a particle could be washed away inthe longest transport out of one small portion of earth thus completelyenclosed by wood in an oak about years old three dicotyledonousplants germinated i am certain of the accuracy of this observation again i can show that the carcasses of birds when floating on the sea sometimes escape being immediately devoured and seeds of many kindsin the crops of floating birds long retain their vitality peas andvetches for instance are killed by even a few days immersion insea water but some taken out of the crop of a pigeon which hadfloated on artificial salt water for days to my surprise nearly allgerminated living birds can hardly fail to be highly effective agents in thetransportation of seeds i could give many facts showing how frequentlybirds of many kinds are blown by gales to vast distances across theocean we may i think safely assume that under such circumstances theirrate of flight would often be miles an hour and some authors havegiven a far higher estimate i have never seen an instance of nutritiousseeds passing through the intestines of a bird but hard seeds of fruitwill pass uninjured through even the digestive organs of a turkey inthe course of two months i picked up in my garden kinds of seeds out of the excrement of small birds and these seemed perfect andsome of them which i tried germinated but the following fact is moreimportant the crops of birds do not secrete gastric juice and do notin the least injure as i know by trial the germination of seeds now after a bird has found and devoured a large supply of food it ispositively asserted that all the grains do not pass into the gizzard for or even hours a bird in this interval might easily be blown tothe distance of miles and hawks are known to look out for tiredbirds and the contents of their torn crops might thus readily getscattered mr brent informs me that a friend of his had to give upflying carrier pigeons from france to england as the hawks on theenglish coast destroyed so many on their arrival some hawks and owlsbolt their prey whole and after an interval of from twelve to twentyhours disgorge pellets which as i know from experiments made in thezoological gardens include seeds capable of germination some seeds ofthe oat wheat millet canary hemp clover and beet germinated afterhaving been from twelve to twenty one hours in the stomachs of differentbirds of prey and two seeds of beet grew after having been thusretained for two days and fourteen hours freshwater fish i find eatseeds of many land and water plants fish are frequently devoured bybirds and thus the seeds might be transported from place to place iforced many kinds of seeds into the stomachs of dead fish and then gavetheir bodies to fishing eagles storks and pelicans these birds afteran interval of many hours either rejected the seeds in pellets orpassed them in their excrement and several of these seeds retainedtheir power of germination certain seeds however were always killedby this process although the beaks and feet of birds are generally quite clean i canshow that earth sometimes adheres to them in one instance i removedtwenty two grains of dry argillaceous earth from one foot of apartridge and in this earth there was a pebble quite as large as theseed of a vetch thus seeds might occasionally be transported to greatdistances for many facts could be given showing that soil almosteverywhere is charged with seeds reflect for a moment on the millionsof quails which annually cross the mediterranean and can we doubt thatthe earth adhering to their feet would sometimes include a few minuteseeds but i shall presently have to recur to this subject as icebergs are known to be sometimes loaded with earth and stones andhave even carried brushwood bones and the nest of a land bird i canhardly doubt that they must occasionally have transported seeds fromone part to another of the arctic and antarctic regions as suggested bylyell and during the glacial period from one part of the now temperateregions to another in the azores from the large number of the speciesof plants common to europe in comparison with the plants of otheroceanic islands nearer to the mainland and as remarked by mr h c watson from the somewhat northern character of the flora in comparisonwith the latitude i suspected that these islands had been partlystocked by ice borne seeds during the glacial epoch at my request sirc lyell wrote to m hartung to inquire whether he had observed erraticboulders on these islands and he answered that he had found largefragments of granite and other rocks which do not occur in thearchipelago hence we may safely infer that icebergs formerly landedtheir rocky burthens on the shores of these mid ocean islands and itis at least possible that they may have brought thither the seeds ofnorthern plants considering that the several above means of transport and that severalother means which without doubt remain to be discovered have been inaction year after year for centuries and tens of thousands of years it would i think be a marvellous fact if many plants had not thusbecome widely transported these means of transport are sometimes calledaccidental but this is not strictly correct the currents of the seaare not accidental nor is the direction of prevalent gales of wind it should be observed that scarcely any means of transport would carryseeds for very great distances for seeds do not retain their vitalitywhen exposed for a great length of time to the action of seawater norcould they be long carried in the crops or intestines of birds thesemeans however would suffice for occasional transport across tracts ofsea some hundred miles in breadth or from island to island or from acontinent to a neighbouring island but not from one distant continentto another the floras of distant continents would not by such meansbecome mingled in any great degree but would remain as distinct as wenow see them to be the currents from their course would never bringseeds from north america to britain though they might and do bringseeds from the west indies to our western shores where if not killedby so long an immersion in salt water they could not endure ourclimate almost every year one or two land birds are blown acrossthe whole atlantic ocean from north america to the western shores ofireland and england but seeds could be transported by these wanderersonly by one means namely in dirt sticking to their feet which is initself a rare accident even in this case how small would the chancebe of a seed falling on favourable soil and coming to maturity but itwould be a great error to argue that because a well stocked island like great britain has not as far as is known and it would be verydifficult to prove this received within the last few centuries through occasional means of transport immigrants from europe or anyother continent that a poorly stocked island though standing moreremote from the mainland would not receive colonists by similar means i do not doubt that out of twenty seeds or animals transported to anisland even if far less well stocked than britain scarcely more thanone would be so well fitted to its new home as to become naturalised but this as it seems to me is no valid argument against what wouldbe effected by occasional means of transport during the long lapse ofgeological time whilst an island was being upheaved and formed andbefore it had become fully stocked with inhabitants on almost bareland with few or no destructive insects or birds living there nearlyevery seed which chanced to arrive would be sure to germinate andsurvive dispersal during the glacial period the identity of many plants and animals on mountain summits separatedfrom each other by hundreds of miles of lowlands where the alpinespecies could not possibly exist is one of the most striking casesknown of the same species living at distant points without the apparentpossibility of their having migrated from one to the other it is indeeda remarkable fact to see so many of the same plants living on the snowyregions of the alps or pyrenees and in the extreme northern parts ofeurope but it is far more remarkable that the plants on the whitemountains in the united states of america are all the same with thoseof labrador and nearly all the same as we hear from asa gray withthose on the loftiest mountains of europe even as long ago as such facts led gmelin to conclude that the same species must have beenindependently created at several distinct points and we might haveremained in this same belief had not agassiz and others called vividattention to the glacial period which as we shall immediately see affords a simple explanation of these facts we have evidence of almostevery conceivable kind organic and inorganic that within a very recentgeological period central europe and north america suffered under anarctic climate the ruins of a house burnt by fire do not tell theirtale more plainly than do the mountains of scotland and wales withtheir scored flanks polished surfaces and perched boulders of the icystreams with which their valleys were lately filled so greatly has theclimate of europe changed that in northern italy gigantic moraines left by old glaciers are now clothed by the vine and maize throughouta large part of the united states erratic boulders and rocks scored bydrifted icebergs and coast ice plainly reveal a former cold period the former influence of the glacial climate on the distribution of theinhabitants of europe as explained with remarkable clearness by edwardforbes is substantially as follows but we shall follow the changesmore readily by supposing a new glacial period to come slowly on andthen pass away as formerly occurred as the cold came on and as eachmore southern zone became fitted for arctic beings and ill fitted fortheir former more temperate inhabitants the latter would be supplantedand arctic productions would take their places the inhabitants of themore temperate regions would at the same time travel southward unlessthey were stopped by barriers in which case they would perish themountains would become covered with snow and ice and their formeralpine inhabitants would descend to the plains by the time that thecold had reached its maximum we should have a uniform arctic fauna andflora covering the central parts of europe as far south as the alpsand pyrenees and even stretching into spain the now temperate regionsof the united states would likewise be covered by arctic plants andanimals and these would be nearly the same with those of europe forthe present circumpolar inhabitants which we suppose to have everywheretravelled southward are remarkably uniform round the world we maysuppose that the glacial period came on a little earlier or later innorth america than in europe so will the southern migration there havebeen a little earlier or later but this will make no difference in thefinal result as the warmth returned the arctic forms would retreat northward closely followed up in their retreat by the productions of the moretemperate regions and as the snow melted from the bases of themountains the arctic forms would seize on the cleared and thawedground always ascending higher and higher as the warmth increased whilst their brethren were pursuing their northern journey hence whenthe warmth had fully returned the same arctic species which had latelylived in a body together on the lowlands of the old and new worlds would be left isolated on distant mountain summits having beenexterminated on all lesser heights and in the arctic regions of bothhemispheres thus we can understand the identity of many plants at points soimmensely remote as on the mountains of the united states and of europe we can thus also understand the fact that the alpine plants of eachmountain range are more especially related to the arctic forms livingdue north or nearly due north of them for the migration as the coldcame on and the re migration on the returning warmth will generallyhave been due south and north the alpine plants for example ofscotland as remarked by mr h c watson and those of the pyrenees asremarked by ramond are more especially allied to the plants of northernscandinavia those of the united states to labrador those of themountains of siberia to the arctic regions of that country these views grounded as they are on the perfectly well ascertained occurrence of aformer glacial period seem to me to explain in so satisfactory a mannerthe present distribution of the alpine and arctic productions of europeand america that when in other regions we find the same species ondistant mountain summits we may almost conclude without other evidence that a colder climate permitted their former migration across the lowintervening tracts since become too warm for their existence if the climate since the glacial period has ever been in any degreewarmer than at present as some geologists in the united states believeto have been the case chiefly from the distribution of the fossilgnathodon then the arctic and temperate productions will at a verylate period have marched a little further north and subsequently haveretreated to their present homes but i have met with no satisfactoryevidence with respect to this intercalated slightly warmer period sincethe glacial period the arctic forms during their long southern migration and re migrationnorthward will have been exposed to nearly the same climate and asis especially to be noticed they will have kept in a body together consequently their mutual relations will not have been much disturbed and in accordance with the principles inculcated in this volume theywill not have been liable to much modification but with our alpineproductions left isolated from the moment of the returning warmth first at the bases and ultimately on the summits of the mountains thecase will have been somewhat different for it is not likely that allthe same arctic species will have been left on mountain ranges distantfrom each other and have survived there ever since they will also inall probability have become mingled with ancient alpine species whichmust have existed on the mountains before the commencement of theglacial epoch and which during its coldest period will have beentemporarily driven down to the plains they will also have beenexposed to somewhat different climatal influences their mutualrelations will thus have been in some degree disturbed consequentlythey will have been liable to modification and this we find has beenthe case for if we compare the present alpine plants and animals of theseveral great european mountain ranges though very many of the speciesare identically the same some present varieties some are rankedas doubtful forms and some few are distinct yet closely allied orrepresentative species in illustrating what as i believe actually took place duringthe glacial period i assumed that at its commencement the arcticproductions were as uniform round the polar regions as they are at thepresent day but the foregoing remarks on distribution apply not onlyto strictly arctic forms but also to many sub arctic and to some fewnorthern temperate forms for some of these are the same on the lowermountains and on the plains of north america and europe and it may bereasonably asked how i account for the necessary degree of uniformityof the sub arctic and northern temperate forms round the world at thecommencement of the glacial period at the present day the sub arcticand northern temperate productions of the old and new worlds areseparated from each other by the atlantic ocean and by the extremenorthern part of the pacific during the glacial period when theinhabitants of the old and new worlds lived further southwards than atpresent they must have been still more completely separated by widerspaces of ocean i believe the above difficulty may be surmounted bylooking to still earlier changes of climate of an opposite nature we have good reason to believe that during the newer pliocene period before the glacial epoch and whilst the majority of the inhabitants ofthe world were specifically the same as now the climate was warmer thanat the present day hence we may suppose that the organisms now livingunder the climate of latitude deg during the pliocene period livedfurther north under the polar circle in latitude deg deg andthat the strictly arctic productions then lived on the broken land stillnearer to the pole now if we look at a globe we shall see that underthe polar circle there is almost continuous land from western europe through siberia to eastern america and to this continuity of thecircumpolar land and to the consequent freedom for intermigrationunder a more favourable climate i attribute the necessary amount ofuniformity in the sub arctic and northern temperate productions of theold and new worlds at a period anterior to the glacial epoch believing from reasons before alluded to that our continents havelong remained in nearly the same relative position though subjectedto large but partial oscillations of level i am strongly inclined toextend the above view and to infer that during some earlier and stillwarmer period such as the older pliocene period a large number ofthe same plants and animals inhabited the almost continuous circumpolarland and that these plants and animals both in the old and new worlds began slowly to migrate southwards as the climate became less warm longbefore the commencement of the glacial period we now see as i believe their descendants mostly in a modified condition in the central partsof europe and the united states on this view we can understand therelationship with very little identity between the productions ofnorth america and europe a relationship which is most remarkable considering the distance of the two areas and their separation by theatlantic ocean we can further understand the singular fact remarked onby several observers that the productions of europe and america duringthe later tertiary stages were more closely related to each otherthan they are at the present time for during these warmer periodsthe northern parts of the old and new worlds will have been almostcontinuously united by land serving as a bridge since renderedimpassable by cold for the inter migration of their inhabitants during the slowly decreasing warmth of the pliocene period as soon asthe species in common which inhabited the new and old worlds migratedsouth of the polar circle they must have been completely cut off fromeach other this separation as far as the more temperate productionsare concerned took place long ages ago and as the plants and animalsmigrated southward they will have become mingled in the one greatregion with the native american productions and have had to competewith them and in the other great region with those of the oldworld consequently we have here everything favourable for muchmodification for far more modification than with the alpineproductions left isolated within a much more recent period on theseveral mountain ranges and on the arctic lands of the two worlds henceit has come that when we compare the now living productions of thetemperate regions of the new and old worlds we find very few identicalspecies though asa gray has lately shown that more plants are identicalthan was formerly supposed but we find in every great class manyforms which some naturalists rank as geographical races and others asdistinct species and a host of closely allied or representative formswhich are ranked by all naturalists as specifically distinct as on the land so in the waters of the sea a slow southern migrationof a marine fauna which during the pliocene or even a somewhat earlierperiod was nearly uniform along the continuous shores of the polarcircle will account on the theory of modification for many closelyallied forms now living in areas completely sundered thus i think wecan understand the presence of many existing and tertiary representativeforms on the eastern and western shores of temperate north america and the still more striking case of many closely allied crustaceans as described in dana s admirable work of some fish and other marineanimals in the mediterranean and in the seas of japan areas nowseparated by a continent and by nearly a hemisphere of equatorial ocean these cases of relationship without identity of the inhabitants ofseas now disjoined and likewise of the past and present inhabitants ofthe temperate lands of north america and europe are inexplicable on thetheory of creation we cannot say that they have been created alike incorrespondence with the nearly similar physical conditions of the areas for if we compare for instance certain parts of south america withthe southern continents of the old world we see countries closelycorresponding in all their physical conditions but with theirinhabitants utterly dissimilar but we must return to our more immediate subject the glacial period i am convinced that forbes s view may be largely extended in europe wehave the plainest evidence of the cold period from the western shoresof britain to the oural range and southward to the pyrenees we mayinfer from the frozen mammals and nature of the mountain vegetation that siberia was similarly affected along the himalaya at points miles apart glaciers have left the marks of their former low descent and in sikkim dr hooker saw maize growing on gigantic ancientmoraines south of the equator we have some direct evidence of formerglacial action in new zealand and the same plants found on widelyseparated mountains in this island tell the same story if one accountwhich has been published can be trusted we have direct evidence ofglacial action in the south eastern corner of australia looking to america in the northern half ice borne fragments of rockhave been observed on the eastern side as far south as lat deg deg and on the shores of the pacific where the climate is now sodifferent as far south as lat deg erratic boulders have also been noticed on the rocky mountains in the cordillera of equatorialsouth america glaciers once extended far below their present level in central chile i was astonished at the structure of a vast mound ofdetritus about feet in height crossing a valley of the andes andthis i now feel convinced was a gigantic moraine left far below anyexisting glacier further south on both sides of the continent fromlat deg to the southernmost extremity we have the clearest evidenceof former glacial action in huge boulders transported far from theirparent source we do not know that the glacial epoch was strictly simultaneous at theseseveral far distant points on opposite sides of the world but we havegood evidence in almost every case that the epoch was included withinthe latest geological period we have also excellent evidence that itendured for an enormous time as measured by years at each point thecold may have come on or have ceased earlier at one point of the globethan at another but seeing that it endured for long at each and thatit was contemporaneous in a geological sense it seems to me probablethat it was during a part at least of the period actually simultaneousthroughout the world without some distinct evidence to the contrary wemay at least admit as probable that the glacial action was simultaneouson the eastern and western sides of north america in the cordilleraunder the equator and under the warmer temperate zones and on bothsides of the southern extremity of the continent if this be admitted it is difficult to avoid believing that the temperature of the wholeworld was at this period simultaneously cooler but it would suffice formy purpose if the temperature was at the same time lower along certainbroad belts of longitude on this view of the whole world or at least of broad longitudinalbelts having been simultaneously colder from pole to pole much lightcan be thrown on the present distribution of identical and alliedspecies in america dr hooker has shown that between forty and fiftyof the flowering plants of tierra del fuego forming no inconsiderablepart of its scanty flora are common to europe enormously remote asthese two points are and there are many closely allied species onthe lofty mountains of equatorial america a host of peculiar speciesbelonging to european genera occur on the highest mountains of brazil some few european genera were found by gardner which do not exist inthe wide intervening hot countries so on the silla of caraccasthe illustrious humboldt long ago found species belonging to generacharacteristic of the cordillera on the mountains of abyssinia severaleuropean forms and some few representatives of the peculiar flora of thecape of good hope occur at the cape of good hope a very few europeanspecies believed not to have been introduced by man and on themountains some few representative european forms are found whichhave not been discovered in the intertropical parts of africa on thehimalaya and on the isolated mountain ranges of the peninsula of india on the heights of ceylon and on the volcanic cones of java many plantsoccur either identically the same or representing each other andat the same time representing plants of europe not found in theintervening hot lowlands a list of the genera collected on the loftierpeaks of java raises a picture of a collection made on a hill in europe still more striking is the fact that southern australian forms areclearly represented by plants growing on the summits of the mountainsof borneo some of these australian forms as i hear from dr hooker extend along the heights of the peninsula of malacca and are thinlyscattered on the one hand over india and on the other as far north asjapan on the southern mountains of australia dr f muller has discoveredseveral european species other species not introduced by man occuron the lowlands and a long list can be given as i am informed bydr hooker of european genera found in australia but not in theintermediate torrid regions in the admirable introduction to the floraof new zealand by dr hooker analogous and striking facts aregiven in regard to the plants of that large island hence we see thatthroughout the world the plants growing on the more lofty mountains and on the temperate lowlands of the northern and southern hemispheres are sometimes identically the same but they are much oftenerspecifically distinct though related to each other in a most remarkablemanner this brief abstract applies to plants alone some strictly analogousfacts could be given on the distribution of terrestrial animals inmarine productions similar cases occur as an example i may quote aremark by the highest authority professor dana that it is certainly awonderful fact that new zealand should have a closer resemblance in itscrustacea to great britain its antipode than to any other part ofthe world sir j richardson also speaks of the reappearance on theshores of new zealand tasmania etc of northern forms of fish dr hooker informs me that twenty five species of algae are common to newzealand and to europe but have not been found in the intermediatetropical seas it should be observed that the northern species and forms found in thesouthern parts of the southern hemisphere and on the mountain rangesof the intertropical regions are not arctic but belong to the northerntemperate zones as mr h c watson has recently remarked in recedingfrom polar towards equatorial latitudes the alpine or mountain florasreally become less and less arctic many of the forms living onthe mountains of the warmer regions of the earth and in the southernhemisphere are of doubtful value being ranked by some naturalists asspecifically distinct by others as varieties but some are certainlyidentical and many though closely related to northern forms must beranked as distinct species now let us see what light can be thrown on the foregoing facts on thebelief supported as it is by a large body of geological evidence thatthe whole world or a large part of it was during the glacial periodsimultaneously much colder than at present the glacial period asmeasured by years must have been very long and when we remember overwhat vast spaces some naturalised plants and animals have spread withina few centuries this period will have been ample for any amount ofmigration as the cold came slowly on all the tropical plants and otherproductions will have retreated from both sides towards the equator followed in the rear by the temperate productions and these by thearctic but with the latter we are not now concerned the tropicalplants probably suffered much extinction how much no one can say perhaps formerly the tropics supported as many species as we see at thepresent day crowded together at the cape of good hope and in parts oftemperate australia as we know that many tropical plants and animalscan withstand a considerable amount of cold many might have escapedextermination during a moderate fall of temperature more especially byescaping into the warmest spots but the great fact to bear in mind is that all tropical productions will have suffered to a certain extent onthe other hand the temperate productions after migrating nearer tothe equator though they will have been placed under somewhat newconditions will have suffered less and it is certain that manytemperate plants if protected from the inroads of competitors canwithstand a much warmer climate than their own hence it seems tome possible bearing in mind that the tropical productions were ina suffering state and could not have presented a firm front againstintruders that a certain number of the more vigorous and dominanttemperate forms might have penetrated the native ranks and have reachedor even crossed the equator the invasion would of course have beengreatly favoured by high land and perhaps by a dry climate for dr falconer informs me that it is the damp with the heat of the tropicswhich is so destructive to perennial plants from a temperate climate onthe other hand the most humid and hottest districts will have affordedan asylum to the tropical natives the mountain ranges north west of thehimalaya and the long line of the cordillera seem to have afforded twogreat lines of invasion and it is a striking fact lately communicatedto me by dr hooker that all the flowering plants about forty six innumber common to tierra del fuego and to europe still exist in northamerica which must have lain on the line of march but i do not doubtthat some temperate productions entered and crossed even the lowlands ofthe tropics at the period when the cold was most intense when arcticforms had migrated some twenty five degrees of latitude from theirnative country and covered the land at the foot of the pyrenees at thisperiod of extreme cold i believe that the climate under the equator atthe level of the sea was about the same with that now felt there at theheight of six or seven thousand feet during this the coldest period isuppose that large spaces of the tropical lowlands were clothed with amingled tropical and temperate vegetation like that now growing withstrange luxuriance at the base of the himalaya as graphically describedby hooker thus as i believe a considerable number of plants a few terrestrialanimals and some marine productions migrated during the glacial periodfrom the northern and southern temperate zones into the intertropicalregions and some even crossed the equator as the warmth returned these temperate forms would naturally ascend the higher mountains beingexterminated on the lowlands those which had not reached the equator would re migrate northward or southward towards their former homes butthe forms chiefly northern which had crossed the equator would travelstill further from their homes into the more temperate latitudes of theopposite hemisphere although we have reason to believe from geologicalevidence that the whole body of arctic shells underwent scarcely anymodification during their long southern migration and re migrationnorthward the case may have been wholly different with those intrudingforms which settled themselves on the intertropical mountains and inthe southern hemisphere these being surrounded by strangers will havehad to compete with many new forms of life and it is probable thatselected modifications in their structure habits and constitutionswill have profited them thus many of these wanderers though stillplainly related by inheritance to their brethren of the northern orsouthern hemispheres now exist in their new homes as well markedvarieties or as distinct species it is a remarkable fact strongly insisted on by hooker in regard toamerica and by alph de candolle in regard to australia that manymore identical plants and allied forms have apparently migrated from thenorth to the south than in a reversed direction we see however afew southern vegetable forms on the mountains of borneo and abyssinia i suspect that this preponderant migration from north to south is dueto the greater extent of land in the north and to the northern formshaving existed in their own homes in greater numbers and havingconsequently been advanced through natural selection and competitionto a higher stage of perfection or dominating power than the southernforms and thus when they became commingled during the glacial period the northern forms were enabled to beat the less powerful southernforms just in the same manner as we see at the present day that verymany european productions cover the ground in la plata and in a lesserdegree in australia and have to a certain extent beaten the natives whereas extremely few southern forms have become naturalised in any partof europe though hides wool and other objects likely to carry seedshave been largely imported into europe during the last two or threecenturies from la plata and during the last thirty or forty yearsfrom australia something of the same kind must have occurred on theintertropical mountains no doubt before the glacial period they werestocked with endemic alpine forms but these have almost everywherelargely yielded to the more dominant forms generated in the largerareas and more efficient workshops of the north in many islands thenative productions are nearly equalled or even outnumbered by thenaturalised and if the natives have not been actually exterminated their numbers have been greatly reduced and this is the first stagetowards extinction a mountain is an island on the land and theintertropical mountains before the glacial period must have beencompletely isolated and i believe that the productions of these islandson the land yielded to those produced within the larger areas of thenorth just in the same way as the productions of real islands haveeverywhere lately yielded to continental forms naturalised by man sagency i am far from supposing that all difficulties are removed on the viewhere given in regard to the range and affinities of the allied specieswhich live in the northern and southern temperate zones and on themountains of the intertropical regions very many difficulties remainto be solved i do not pretend to indicate the exact lines and meansof migration or the reason why certain species and not others havemigrated why certain species have been modified and have given rise tonew groups of forms and others have remained unaltered we cannot hopeto explain such facts until we can say why one species and not anotherbecomes naturalised by man s agency in a foreign land why one rangestwice or thrice as far and is twice or thrice as common as anotherspecies within their own homes i have said that many difficulties remain to be solved some of themost remarkable are stated with admirable clearness by dr hooker inhis botanical works on the antarctic regions these cannot be herediscussed i will only say that as far as regards the occurrence ofidentical species at points so enormously remote as kerguelen land newzealand and fuegia i believe that towards the close of the glacialperiod icebergs as suggested by lyell have been largely concerned intheir dispersal but the existence of several quite distinct species belonging to genera exclusively confined to the south at these andother distant points of the southern hemisphere is on my theory ofdescent with modification a far more remarkable case of difficulty forsome of these species are so distinct that we cannot suppose that therehas been time since the commencement of the glacial period for theirmigration and for their subsequent modification to the necessarydegree the facts seem to me to indicate that peculiar and very distinctspecies have migrated in radiating lines from some common centre and iam inclined to look in the southern as in the northern hemisphere to aformer and warmer period before the commencement of the glacial period when the antarctic lands now covered with ice supported a highlypeculiar and isolated flora i suspect that before this flora wasexterminated by the glacial epoch a few forms were widely dispersedto various points of the southern hemisphere by occasional means oftransport and by the aid as halting places of existing and now sunkenislands and perhaps at the commencement of the glacial period byicebergs by these means as i believe the southern shores of america australia new zealand have become slightly tinted by the same peculiarforms of vegetable life sir c lyell in a striking passage has speculated in language almostidentical with mine on the effects of great alternations of climate ongeographical distribution i believe that the world has recently feltone of his great cycles of change and that on this view combined withmodification through natural selection a multitude of facts in thepresent distribution both of the same and of allied forms of life can beexplained the living waters may be said to have flowed during one shortperiod from the north and from the south and to have crossed at theequator but to have flowed with greater force from the north so asto have freely inundated the south as the tide leaves its drift inhorizontal lines though rising higher on the shores where the tiderises highest so have the living waters left their living drift on ourmountain summits in a line gently rising from the arctic lowlands toa great height under the equator the various beings thus left strandedmay be compared with savage races of man driven up and surviving in themountain fastnesses of almost every land which serve as a record full of interest to us of the former inhabitants of the surroundinglowlands geographical distribution continued distribution of fresh water productions on the inhabitants of oceanicislands absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals on therelation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification summary of the last and present chapters as lakes and river systems are separated from each other by barriers ofland it might have been thought that fresh water productions would nothave ranged widely within the same country and as the sea is apparentlya still more impassable barrier that they never would have extended todistant countries but the case is exactly the reverse not only havemany fresh water species belonging to quite different classes anenormous range but allied species prevail in a remarkable mannerthroughout the world i well remember when first collecting in thefresh waters of brazil feeling much surprise at the similarity ofthe fresh water insects shells etc and at the dissimilarity of thesurrounding terrestrial beings compared with those of britain but this power in fresh water productions of ranging widely though sounexpected can i think in most cases be explained by their havingbecome fitted in a manner highly useful to them for short and frequentmigrations from pond to pond or from stream to stream and liabilityto wide dispersal would follow from this capacity as an almost necessaryconsequence we can here consider only a few cases in regard to fish ibelieve that the same species never occur in the fresh waters of distantcontinents but on the same continent the species often range widely andalmost capriciously for two river systems will have some fish in commonand some different a few facts seem to favour the possibility of theiroccasional transport by accidental means like that of the live fishnot rarely dropped by whirlwinds in india and the vitality of theirova when removed from the water but i am inclined to attribute thedispersal of fresh water fish mainly to slight changes within the recentperiod in the level of the land having caused rivers to flow into eachother instances also could be given of this having occurred duringfloods without any change of level we have evidence in the loess ofthe rhine of considerable changes of level in the land within a veryrecent geological period and when the surface was peopled by existingland and fresh water shells the wide difference of the fish on oppositesides of continuous mountain ranges which from an early period musthave parted river systems and completely prevented their inosculation seems to lead to this same conclusion with respect to alliedfresh water fish occurring at very distant points of the world no doubtthere are many cases which cannot at present be explained but somefresh water fish belong to very ancient forms and in such casesthere will have been ample time for great geographical changes andconsequently time and means for much migration in the second place salt water fish can with care be slowly accustomed to live in freshwater and according to valenciennes there is hardly a single group offishes confined exclusively to fresh water so that we may imagine thata marine member of a fresh water group might travel far along the shoresof the sea and subsequently become modified and adapted to the freshwaters of a distant land some species of fresh water shells have a very wide range and alliedspecies which on my theory are descended from a common parent andmust have proceeded from a single source prevail throughout the world their distribution at first perplexed me much as their ova are notlikely to be transported by birds and they are immediately killedby sea water as are the adults i could not even understand how somenaturalised species have rapidly spread throughout the same country buttwo facts which i have observed and no doubt many others remain to beobserved throw some light on this subject when a duck suddenly emergesfrom a pond covered with duck weed i have twice seen these littleplants adhering to its back and it has happened to me in removinga little duck weed from one aquarium to another that i have quiteunintentionally stocked the one with fresh water shells from the other but another agency is perhaps more effectual i suspended a duck s feet which might represent those of a bird sleeping in a natural pond inan aquarium where many ova of fresh water shells were hatching andi found that numbers of the extremely minute and just hatched shellscrawled on the feet and clung to them so firmly that when taken outof the water they could not be jarred off though at a somewhat moreadvanced age they would voluntarily drop off these just hatchedmolluscs though aquatic in their nature survived on the duck s feet in damp air from twelve to twenty hours and in this length of time aduck or heron might fly at least six or seven hundred miles and wouldbe sure to alight on a pool or rivulet if blown across sea to anoceanic island or to any other distant point sir charles lyell alsoinforms me that a dyticus has been caught with an ancylus a fresh watershell like a limpet firmly adhering to it and a water beetle ofthe same family a colymbetes once flew on board the beagle whenforty five miles distant from the nearest land how much farther itmight have flown with a favouring gale no one can tell with respect to plants it has long been known what enormous ranges manyfresh water and even marsh species have both over continents and to themost remote oceanic islands this is strikingly shown as remarked byalph de candolle in large groups of terrestrial plants which haveonly a very few aquatic members for these latter seem immediately toacquire as if in consequence a very wide range i think favourablemeans of dispersal explain this fact i have before mentioned that earthoccasionally though rarely adheres in some quantity to the feet andbeaks of birds wading birds which frequent the muddy edges of ponds if suddenly flushed would be the most likely to have muddy feet birds of this order i can show are the greatest wanderers and areoccasionally found on the most remote and barren islands in the openocean they would not be likely to alight on the surface of the sea sothat the dirt would not be washed off their feet when making land they would be sure to fly to their natural fresh water haunts i do notbelieve that botanists are aware how charged the mud of ponds is withseeds i have tried several little experiments but will here give onlythe most striking case i took in february three table spoonfuls ofmud from three different points beneath water on the edge of a littlepond this mud when dry weighed only ounces i kept it coveredup in my study for six months pulling up and counting each plant as itgrew the plants were of many kinds and were altogether in number and yet the viscid mud was all contained in a breakfast cup consideringthese facts i think it would be an inexplicable circumstance ifwater birds did not transport the seeds of fresh water plants to vastdistances and if consequently the range of these plants was not verygreat the same agency may have come into play with the eggs of some ofthe smaller fresh water animals other and unknown agencies probably have also played a part i havestated that fresh water fish eat some kinds of seeds though they rejectmany other kinds after having swallowed them even small fish swallowseeds of moderate size as of the yellow water lily and potamogeton herons and other birds century after century have gone on dailydevouring fish they then take flight and go to other waters or areblown across the sea and we have seen that seeds retain their powerof germination when rejected in pellets or in excrement many hoursafterwards when i saw the great size of the seeds of that finewater lily the nelumbium and remembered alph de candolle s remarkson this plant i thought that its distribution must remain quiteinexplicable but audubon states that he found the seeds of the greatsouthern water lily probably according to dr hooker the nelumbiumluteum in a heron s stomach although i do not know the fact yetanalogy makes me believe that a heron flying to another pond and gettinga hearty meal of fish would probably reject from its stomach a pelletcontaining the seeds of the nelumbium undigested or the seeds might bedropped by the bird whilst feeding its young in the same way as fishare known sometimes to be dropped in considering these several means of distribution it should beremembered that when a pond or stream is first formed for instance on a rising islet it will be unoccupied and a single seed or eggwill have a good chance of succeeding although there will always be astruggle for life between the individuals of the species howeverfew already occupying any pond yet as the number of kinds is small compared with those on the land the competition will probably be lesssevere between aquatic than between terrestrial species consequentlyan intruder from the waters of a foreign country would have a betterchance of seizing on a place than in the case of terrestrial colonists we should also remember that some perhaps many fresh waterproductions are low in the scale of nature and that we have reason tobelieve that such low beings change or become modified less quicklythan the high and this will give longer time than the average forthe migration of the same aquatic species we should not forget theprobability of many species having formerly ranged as continuously asfresh water productions ever can range over immense areas and havingsubsequently become extinct in intermediate regions but the widedistribution of fresh water plants and of the lower animals whetherretaining the same identical form or in some degree modified i believemainly depends on the wide dispersal of their seeds and eggs by animals more especially by fresh water birds which have large powers of flight and naturally travel from one to another and often distant piece ofwater nature like a careful gardener thus takes her seeds from a bedof a particular nature and drops them in another equally well fittedfor them on the inhabitants of oceanic islands we now come to the last of the three classes of facts which i haveselected as presenting the greatest amount of difficulty on the viewthat all the individuals both of the same and of allied species havedescended from a single parent and therefore have all proceeded from acommon birthplace notwithstanding that in the course of time they havecome to inhabit distant points of the globe i have already stated thati cannot honestly admit forbes s view on continental extensions which if legitimately followed out would lead to the belief that within therecent period all existing islands have been nearly or quite joined tosome continent this view would remove many difficulties but it wouldnot i think explain all the facts in regard to insular productions inthe following remarks i shall not confine myself to the mere question ofdispersal but shall consider some other facts which bear on thetruth of the two theories of independent creation and of descent withmodification the species of all kinds which inhabit oceanic islands are few in numbercompared with those on equal continental areas alph de candolle admitsthis for plants and wollaston for insects if we look to the largesize and varied stations of new zealand extending over miles oflatitude and compare its flowering plants only in number withthose on an equal area at the cape of good hope or in australia we must i think admit that something quite independently of anydifference in physical conditions has caused so great a difference innumber even the uniform county of cambridge has plants and thelittle island of anglesea but a few ferns and a few introducedplants are included in these numbers and the comparison in some otherrespects is not quite fair we have evidence that the barren island ofascension aboriginally possessed under half a dozen flowering plants yet many have become naturalised on it as they have on new zealand andon every other oceanic island which can be named in st helena there isreason to believe that the naturalised plants and animals have nearly orquite exterminated many native productions he who admits the doctrineof the creation of each separate species will have to admit that asufficient number of the best adapted plants and animals have not beencreated on oceanic islands for man has unintentionally stocked themfrom various sources far more fully and perfectly than has nature although in oceanic islands the number of kinds of inhabitants isscanty the proportion of endemic species i e those found nowhere elsein the world is often extremely large if we compare for instance thenumber of the endemic land shells in madeira or of the endemic birds inthe galapagos archipelago with the number found on any continent andthen compare the area of the islands with that of the continent weshall see that this is true this fact might have been expected on mytheory for as already explained species occasionally arriving afterlong intervals in a new and isolated district and having to competewith new associates will be eminently liable to modification andwill often produce groups of modified descendants but it by no meansfollows that because in an island nearly all the species of one classare peculiar those of another class or of another section of the sameclass are peculiar and this difference seems to depend on the specieswhich do not become modified having immigrated with facility and in abody so that their mutual relations have not been much disturbed thusin the galapagos islands nearly every land bird but only two out of theeleven marine birds are peculiar and it is obvious that marine birdscould arrive at these islands more easily than land birds bermuda onthe other hand which lies at about the same distance from north americaas the galapagos islands do from south america and which has a verypeculiar soil does not possess one endemic land bird and we know frommr j m jones s admirable account of bermuda that very many northamerican birds during their great annual migrations visit eitherperiodically or occasionally this island madeira does not possess onepeculiar bird and many european and african birds are almost every yearblown there as i am informed by mr e v harcourt so that these twoislands of bermuda and madeira have been stocked by birds which forlong ages have struggled together in their former homes and have becomemutually adapted to each other and when settled in their new homes each kind will have been kept by the others to their proper places andhabits and will consequently have been little liable to modification madeira again is inhabited by a wonderful number of peculiarland shells whereas not one species of sea shell is confined to itsshores now though we do not know how seashells are dispersed yetwe can see that their eggs or larvae perhaps attached to seaweed orfloating timber or to the feet of wading birds might be transportedfar more easily than land shells across three or four hundred miles ofopen sea the different orders of insects in madeira apparently presentanalogous facts oceanic islands are sometimes deficient in certain classes andtheir places are apparently occupied by the other inhabitants in thegalapagos islands reptiles and in new zealand gigantic wingless birds take the place of mammals in the plants of the galapagos islands dr hooker has shown that the proportional numbers of the differentorders are very different from what they are elsewhere such cases aregenerally accounted for by the physical conditions of the islands but this explanation seems to me not a little doubtful facility ofimmigration i believe has been at least as important as the nature ofthe conditions many remarkable little facts could be given with respect to theinhabitants of remote islands for instance in certain islands nottenanted by mammals some of the endemic plants have beautifully hookedseeds yet few relations are more striking than the adaptation of hookedseeds for transportal by the wool and fur of quadrupeds thiscase presents no difficulty on my view for a hooked seed might betransported to an island by some other means and the plant thenbecoming slightly modified but still retaining its hooked seeds would form an endemic species having as useless an appendage as anyrudimentary organ for instance as the shrivelled wings under thesoldered elytra of many insular beetles again islands often possesstrees or bushes belonging to orders which elsewhere include onlyherbaceous species now trees as alph de candolle has shown generallyhave whatever the cause may be confined ranges hence trees would belittle likely to reach distant oceanic islands and an herbaceous plant though it would have no chance of successfully competing in staturewith a fully developed tree when established on an island and having tocompete with herbaceous plants alone might readily gain an advantageby growing taller and taller and overtopping the other plants if so natural selection would often tend to add to the stature of herbaceousplants when growing on an island to whatever order they belonged andthus convert them first into bushes and ultimately into trees with respect to the absence of whole orders on oceanic islands bory st vincent long ago remarked that batrachians frogs toads newts havenever been found on any of the many islands with which the great oceansare studded i have taken pains to verify this assertion and i havefound it strictly true i have however been assured that a frog existson the mountains of the great island of new zealand but i suspect thatthis exception if the information be correct may be explained throughglacial agency this general absence of frogs toads and newts onso many oceanic islands cannot be accounted for by their physicalconditions indeed it seems that islands are peculiarly well fitted forthese animals for frogs have been introduced into madeira the azores and mauritius and have multiplied so as to become a nuisance but asthese animals and their spawn are known to be immediately killed bysea water on my view we can see that there would be great difficulty intheir transportal across the sea and therefore why they do not exist onany oceanic island but why on the theory of creation they should nothave been created there it would be very difficult to explain mammals offer another and similar case i have carefully searched theoldest voyages but have not finished my search as yet i have not founda single instance free from doubt of a terrestrial mammal excludingdomesticated animals kept by the natives inhabiting an island situatedabove miles from a continent or great continental island andmany islands situated at a much less distance are equally barren thefalkland islands which are inhabited by a wolf like fox come nearestto an exception but this group cannot be considered as oceanic as itlies on a bank connected with the mainland moreover icebergs formerlybrought boulders to its western shores and they may have formerlytransported foxes as so frequently now happens in the arctic regions yet it cannot be said that small islands will not support small mammals for they occur in many parts of the world on very small islands ifclose to a continent and hardly an island can be named on which oursmaller quadrupeds have not become naturalised and greatly multiplied it cannot be said on the ordinary view of creation that there hasnot been time for the creation of mammals many volcanic islands aresufficiently ancient as shown by the stupendous degradation which theyhave suffered and by their tertiary strata there has also been timefor the production of endemic species belonging to other classes and oncontinents it is thought that mammals appear and disappear at a quickerrate than other and lower animals though terrestrial mammals do notoccur on oceanic islands aerial mammals do occur on almost everyisland new zealand possesses two bats found nowhere else in the world norfolk island the viti archipelago the bonin islands the carolineand marianne archipelagoes and mauritius all possess their peculiarbats why it may be asked has the supposed creative force producedbats and no other mammals on remote islands on my view this questioncan easily be answered for no terrestrial mammal can be transportedacross a wide space of sea but bats can fly across bats have been seenwandering by day far over the atlantic ocean and two north americanspecies either regularly or occasionally visit bermuda at the distanceof miles from the mainland i hear from mr tomes who has speciallystudied this family that many of the same species have enormous ranges and are found on continents and on far distant islands hence we haveonly to suppose that such wandering species have been modified throughnatural selection in their new homes in relation to their new position and we can understand the presence of endemic bats on islands with theabsence of all terrestrial mammals besides the absence of terrestrial mammals in relation to the remotenessof islands from continents there is also a relation to a certainextent independent of distance between the depth of the sea separatingan island from the neighbouring mainland and the presence in both ofthe same mammiferous species or of allied species in a more or lessmodified condition mr windsor earl has made some striking observationson this head in regard to the great malay archipelago which istraversed near celebes by a space of deep ocean and this spaceseparates two widely distinct mammalian faunas on either side theislands are situated on moderately deep submarine banks and they areinhabited by closely allied or identical quadrupeds no doubt some fewanomalies occur in this great archipelago and there is much difficultyin forming a judgment in some cases owing to the probable naturalisationof certain mammals through man s agency but we shall soon have muchlight thrown on the natural history of this archipelago by the admirablezeal and researches of mr wallace i have not as yet had time to followup this subject in all other quarters of the world but as far as i havegone the relation generally holds good we see britain separated by ashallow channel from europe and the mammals are the same on bothsides we meet with analogous facts on many islands separated by similarchannels from australia the west indian islands stand on a deeplysubmerged bank nearly fathoms in depth and here we find americanforms but the species and even the genera are distinct as the amountof modification in all cases depends to a certain degree on the lapseof time and as during changes of level it is obvious that islandsseparated by shallow channels are more likely to have been continuouslyunited within a recent period to the mainland than islands separatedby deeper channels we can understand the frequent relation between thedepth of the sea and the degree of affinity of the mammalian inhabitantsof islands with those of a neighbouring continent an inexplicablerelation on the view of independent acts of creation all the foregoing remarks on the inhabitants of oceanicislands namely the scarcity of kinds the richness in endemic formsin particular classes or sections of classes the absence of wholegroups as of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals notwithstandingthe presence of aerial bats the singular proportions of certainorders of plants herbaceous forms having been developed into trees etc seem to me to accord better with the view of occasional means oftransport having been largely efficient in the long course of time thanwith the view of all our oceanic islands having been formerly connectedby continuous land with the nearest continent for on this latterview the migration would probably have been more complete and ifmodification be admitted all the forms of life would have been moreequally modified in accordance with the paramount importance of therelation of organism to organism i do not deny that there are many and grave difficulties inunderstanding how several of the inhabitants of the more remote islands whether still retaining the same specific form or modified since theirarrival could have reached their present homes but the probability ofmany islands having existed as halting places of which not a wreck nowremains must not be overlooked i will here give a single instance ofone of the cases of difficulty almost all oceanic islands even themost isolated and smallest are inhabited by land shells generally byendemic species but sometimes by species found elsewhere dr aug a gould has given several interesting cases in regard to the land shellsof the islands of the pacific now it is notorious that land shells arevery easily killed by salt their eggs at least such as i have tried sink in sea water and are killed by it yet there must be on my view some unknown but highly efficient means for their transportal wouldthe just hatched young occasionally crawl on and adhere to the feet ofbirds roosting on the ground and thus get transported it occurred tome that land shells when hybernating and having a membranous diaphragmover the mouth of the shell might be floated in chinks of driftedtimber across moderately wide arms of the sea and i found that severalspecies did in this state withstand uninjured an immersion in sea waterduring seven days one of these shells was the helix pomatia and afterit had again hybernated i put it in sea water for twenty days and itperfectly recovered as this species has a thick calcareous operculum i removed it and when it had formed a new membranous one i immersed itfor fourteen days in sea water and it recovered and crawled away but more experiments are wanted on this head the most striking andimportant fact for us in regard to the inhabitants of islands is theiraffinity to those of the nearest mainland without being actually thesame species numerous instances could be given of this fact i willgive only one that of the galapagos archipelago situated under theequator between and miles from the shores of south america here almost every product of the land and water bears the unmistakeablestamp of the american continent there are twenty six land birds and twenty five of these are ranked by mr gould as distinct species supposed to have been created here yet the close affinity of most ofthese birds to american species in every character in their habits gestures and tones of voice was manifest so it is with the otheranimals and with nearly all the plants as shown by dr hooker inhis admirable memoir on the flora of this archipelago the naturalist looking at the inhabitants of these volcanic islands in the pacific distant several hundred miles from the continent yet feels that he isstanding on american land why should this be so why should the specieswhich are supposed to have been created in the galapagos archipelago and nowhere else bear so plain a stamp of affinity to those created inamerica there is nothing in the conditions of life in the geologicalnature of the islands in their height or climate or in the proportionsin which the several classes are associated together which resemblesclosely the conditions of the south american coast in fact there isa considerable dissimilarity in all these respects on the other hand there is a considerable degree of resemblance in the volcanic natureof the soil in climate height and size of the islands betweenthe galapagos and cape de verde archipelagos but what an entire andabsolute difference in their inhabitants the inhabitants of the capede verde islands are related to those of africa like those of thegalapagos to america i believe this grand fact can receive no sort ofexplanation on the ordinary view of independent creation whereas on theview here maintained it is obvious that the galapagos islands would belikely to receive colonists whether by occasional means of transport orby formerly continuous land from america and the cape de verdeislands from africa and that such colonists would be liable tomodification the principle of inheritance still betraying theiroriginal birthplace many analogous facts could be given indeed it is an almost universalrule that the endemic productions of islands are related to those of thenearest continent or of other near islands the exceptions are few andmost of them can be explained thus the plants of kerguelen land thoughstanding nearer to africa than to america are related and that veryclosely as we know from dr hooker s account to those of america buton the view that this island has been mainly stocked by seeds broughtwith earth and stones on icebergs drifted by the prevailing currents this anomaly disappears new zealand in its endemic plants is much moreclosely related to australia the nearest mainland than to any otherregion and this is what might have been expected but it is alsoplainly related to south america which although the next nearestcontinent is so enormously remote that the fact becomes an anomaly but this difficulty almost disappears on the view that both new zealand south america and other southern lands were long ago partially stockedfrom a nearly intermediate though distant point namely from theantarctic islands when they were clothed with vegetation before thecommencement of the glacial period the affinity which thoughfeeble i am assured by dr hooker is real between the flora of thesouth western corner of australia and of the cape of good hope is a farmore remarkable case and is at present inexplicable but this affinityis confined to the plants and will i do not doubt be some dayexplained the law which causes the inhabitants of an archipelago thoughspecifically distinct to be closely allied to those of the nearestcontinent we sometimes see displayed on a small scale yet in a mostinteresting manner within the limits of the same archipelago thus theseveral islands of the galapagos archipelago are tenanted as i haveelsewhere shown in a quite marvellous manner by very closely relatedspecies so that the inhabitants of each separate island though mostlydistinct are related in an incomparably closer degree to each otherthan to the inhabitants of any other part of the world and this is justwhat might have been expected on my view for the islands are situatedso near each other that they would almost certainly receiveimmigrants from the same original source or from each other but thisdissimilarity between the endemic inhabitants of the islands may beused as an argument against my views for it may be asked how has ithappened in the several islands situated within sight of each other having the same geological nature the same height climate etc thatmany of the immigrants should have been differently modified thoughonly in a small degree this long appeared to me a great difficulty butit arises in chief part from the deeply seated error of consideringthe physical conditions of a country as the most important for itsinhabitants whereas it cannot i think be disputed that the nature ofthe other inhabitants with which each has to compete is at least asimportant and generally a far more important element of success nowif we look to those inhabitants of the galapagos archipelago which arefound in other parts of the world laying on one side for the momentthe endemic species which cannot be here fairly included as we areconsidering how they have come to be modified since their arrival wefind a considerable amount of difference in the several islands thisdifference might indeed have been expected on the view of the islandshaving been stocked by occasional means of transport a seed forinstance of one plant having been brought to one island and that ofanother plant to another island hence when in former times an immigrantsettled on any one or more of the islands or when it subsequentlyspread from one island to another it would undoubtedly be exposed todifferent conditions of life in the different islands for it wouldhave to compete with different sets of organisms a plant for instance would find the best fitted ground more perfectly occupied by distinctplants in one island than in another and it would be exposed to theattacks of somewhat different enemies if then it varied naturalselection would probably favour different varieties in the differentislands some species however might spread and yet retain the samecharacter throughout the group just as we see on continents somespecies spreading widely and remaining the same the really surprising fact in this case of the galapagos archipelago and in a lesser degree in some analogous instances is that the newspecies formed in the separate islands have not quickly spread to theother islands but the islands though in sight of each other areseparated by deep arms of the sea in most cases wider than the britishchannel and there is no reason to suppose that they have at any formerperiod been continuously united the currents of the sea are rapid andsweep across the archipelago and gales of wind are extraordinarilyrare so that the islands are far more effectually separated from eachother than they appear to be on a map nevertheless a good many species both those found in other parts of the world and those confined to thearchipelago are common to the several islands and we may infer fromcertain facts that these have probably spread from some one islandto the others but we often take i think an erroneous view of theprobability of closely allied species invading each other s territory when put into free intercommunication undoubtedly if one species hasany advantage whatever over another it will in a very brief time whollyor in part supplant it but if both are equally well fitted for theirown places in nature both probably will hold their own places and keepseparate for almost any length of time being familiar with the factthat many species naturalised through man s agency have spread withastonishing rapidity over new countries we are apt to infer that mostspecies would thus spread but we should remember that the forms whichbecome naturalised in new countries are not generally closely allied tothe aboriginal inhabitants but are very distinct species belonging ina large proportion of cases as shown by alph de candolle to distinctgenera in the galapagos archipelago many even of the birds thoughso well adapted for flying from island to island are distinct on each thus there are three closely allied species of mocking thrush eachconfined to its own island now let us suppose the mocking thrushof chatham island to be blown to charles island which has its ownmocking thrush why should it succeed in establishing itself there we may safely infer that charles island is well stocked with its ownspecies for annually more eggs are laid there than can possibly bereared and we may infer that the mocking thrush peculiar to charlesisland is at least as well fitted for its home as is the speciespeculiar to chatham island sir c lyell and mr wollaston havecommunicated to me a remarkable fact bearing on this subject namely that madeira and the adjoining islet of porto santo possess manydistinct but representative land shells some of which live increvices of stone and although large quantities of stone are annuallytransported from porto santo to madeira yet this latter island has notbecome colonised by the porto santo species nevertheless both islandshave been colonised by some european land shells which no doubt hadsome advantage over the indigenous species from these considerationsi think we need not greatly marvel at the endemic and representativespecies which inhabit the several islands of the galapagos archipelago not having universally spread from island to island in many otherinstances as in the several districts of the same continent pre occupation has probably played an important part in checking thecommingling of species under the same conditions of life thus thesouth east and south west corners of australia have nearly the samephysical conditions and are united by continuous land yet they areinhabited by a vast number of distinct mammals birds and plants the principle which determines the general character of the faunaand flora of oceanic islands namely that the inhabitants when notidentically the same yet are plainly related to the inhabitants ofthat region whence colonists could most readily have been derived thecolonists having been subsequently modified and better fitted to theirnew homes is of the widest application throughout nature we seethis on every mountain in every lake and marsh for alpine species excepting in so far as the same forms chiefly of plants have spreadwidely throughout the world during the recent glacial epoch are relatedto those of the surrounding lowlands thus we have in south america alpine humming birds alpine rodents alpine plants etc all ofstrictly american forms and it is obvious that a mountain as it becameslowly upheaved would naturally be colonised from the surroundinglowlands so it is with the inhabitants of lakes and marshes exceptingin so far as great facility of transport has given the same generalforms to the whole world we see this same principle in the blindanimals inhabiting the caves of america and of europe other analogousfacts could be given and it will i believe be universally found tobe true that wherever in two regions let them be ever so distant manyclosely allied or representative species occur there will likewise befound some identical species showing in accordance with the foregoingview that at some former period there has been intercommunication ormigration between the two regions and wherever many closely alliedspecies occur there will be found many forms which some naturalistsrank as distinct species and some as varieties these doubtful formsshowing us the steps in the process of modification this relation between the power and extent of migration of a species either at the present time or at some former period under differentphysical conditions and the existence at remote points of the world ofother species allied to it is shown in another and more general way mr gould remarked to me long ago that in those genera of birds whichrange over the world many of the species have very wide ranges ican hardly doubt that this rule is generally true though it would bedifficult to prove it amongst mammals we see it strikingly displayedin bats and in a lesser degree in the felidae and canidae we see it if we compare the distribution of butterflies and beetles so it is withmost fresh water productions in which so many genera range over theworld and many individual species have enormous ranges it is not meantthat in world ranging genera all the species have a wide range or eventhat they have on an average a wide range but only that some of thespecies range very widely for the facility with which widely rangingspecies vary and give rise to new forms will largely determine theiraverage range for instance two varieties of the same species inhabitamerica and europe and the species thus has an immense range but ifthe variation had been a little greater the two varieties would havebeen ranked as distinct species and the common range would have beengreatly reduced still less is it meant that a species which apparentlyhas the capacity of crossing barriers and ranging widely as in the caseof certain powerfully winged birds will necessarily range widely forwe should never forget that to range widely implies not only the powerof crossing barriers but the more important power of being victoriousin distant lands in the struggle for life with foreign associates buton the view of all the species of a genus having descended from a singleparent though now distributed to the most remote points of the world we ought to find and i believe as a general rule we do find that someat least of the species range very widely for it is necessary that theunmodified parent should range widely undergoing modification duringits diffusion and should place itself under diverse conditionsfavourable for the conversion of its offspring firstly into newvarieties and ultimately into new species in considering the wide distribution of certain genera we should bearin mind that some are extremely ancient and must have branched off froma common parent at a remote epoch so that in such cases there willhave been ample time for great climatal and geographical changes and foraccidents of transport and consequently for the migration of some ofthe species into all quarters of the world where they may have becomeslightly modified in relation to their new conditions there is also some reason to believe from geological evidence that organisms low inthe scale within each great class generally change at a slower ratethan the higher forms and consequently the lower forms will have had abetter chance of ranging widely and of still retaining the same specificcharacter this fact together with the seeds and eggs of many low formsbeing very minute and better fitted for distant transportation probablyaccounts for a law which has long been observed and which has latelybeen admirably discussed by alph de candolle in regard to plants namely that the lower any group of organisms is the more widely it isapt to range the relations just discussed namely low and slowly changingorganisms ranging more widely than the high some of the species ofwidely ranging genera themselves ranging widely such facts as alpine lacustrine and marsh productions being related with the exceptionsbefore specified to those on the surrounding low lands and dry lands though these stations are so different the very close relation of thedistinct species which inhabit the islets of the same archipelago andespecially the striking relation of the inhabitants of each wholearchipelago or island to those of the nearest mainland are i think utterly inexplicable on the ordinary view of the independent creationof each species but are explicable on the view of colonisation from thenearest and readiest source together with the subsequent modificationand better adaptation of the colonists to their new homes summary of last and present chapters in these chapters i have endeavoured to show that if we make dueallowance for our ignorance of the full effects of all the changes ofclimate and of the level of the land which have certainly occurredwithin the recent period and of other similar changes which may haveoccurred within the same period if we remember how profoundly ignorantwe are with respect to the many and curious means of occasionaltransport a subject which has hardly ever been properly experimentisedon if we bear in mind how often a species may have ranged continuouslyover a wide area and then have become extinct in the intermediatetracts i think the difficulties in believing that all the individualsof the same species wherever located have descended from the sameparents are not insuperable and we are led to this conclusion whichhas been arrived at by many naturalists under the designation of singlecentres of creation by some general considerations more especiallyfrom the importance of barriers and from the analogical distribution ofsub genera genera and families with respect to the distinct species of the same genus which on mytheory must have spread from one parent source if we make the sameallowances as before for our ignorance and remember that some forms oflife change most slowly enormous periods of time being thus granted fortheir migration i do not think that the difficulties are insuperable though they often are in this case and in that of the individuals ofthe same species extremely grave as exemplifying the effects of climatal changes on distribution i haveattempted to show how important has been the influence of the modernglacial period which i am fully convinced simultaneously affectedthe whole world or at least great meridional belts as showing howdiversified are the means of occasional transport i have discussed atsome little length the means of dispersal of fresh water productions if the difficulties be not insuperable in admitting that in the longcourse of time the individuals of the same species and likewise ofallied species have proceeded from some one source then i think allthe grand leading facts of geographical distribution are explicable onthe theory of migration generally of the more dominant forms of life together with subsequent modification and the multiplication of newforms we can thus understand the high importance of barriers whetherof land or water which separate our several zoological and botanicalprovinces we can thus understand the localisation of sub genera genera and families and how it is that under different latitudes forinstance in south america the inhabitants of the plains and mountains of the forests marshes and deserts are in so mysterious a mannerlinked together by affinity and are likewise linked to the extinctbeings which formerly inhabited the same continent bearing in mindthat the mutual relations of organism to organism are of the highestimportance we can see why two areas having nearly the same physicalconditions should often be inhabited by very different forms oflife for according to the length of time which has elapsed sincenew inhabitants entered one region according to the nature of thecommunication which allowed certain forms and not others to enter either in greater or lesser numbers according or not as those whichentered happened to come in more or less direct competition with eachother and with the aborigines and according as the immigrants werecapable of varying more or less rapidly there would ensue in differentregions independently of their physical conditions infinitelydiversified conditions of life there would be an almost endless amountof organic action and reaction and we should find as we do find some groups of beings greatly and some only slightly modified somedeveloped in great force some existing in scanty numbers in thedifferent great geographical provinces of the world on these same principles we can understand as i have endeavoured toshow why oceanic islands should have few inhabitants but of these agreat number should be endemic or peculiar and why in relation to themeans of migration one group of beings even within the same class should have all its species endemic and another group should have allits species common to other quarters of the world we can see why wholegroups of organisms as batrachians and terrestrial mammals should beabsent from oceanic islands whilst the most isolated islands possesstheir own peculiar species of aerial mammals or bats we can see whythere should be some relation between the presence of mammals in a moreor less modified condition and the depth of the sea between an islandand the mainland we can clearly see why all the inhabitants of anarchipelago though specifically distinct on the several islets shouldbe closely related to each other and likewise be related but lessclosely to those of the nearest continent or other source whenceimmigrants were probably derived we can see why in two areas howeverdistant from each other there should be a correlation in the presenceof identical species of varieties of doubtful species and of distinctbut representative species as the late edward forbes often insisted there is a strikingparallelism in the laws of life throughout time and space the lawsgoverning the succession of forms in past times being nearly the samewith those governing at the present time the differences in differentareas we see this in many facts the endurance of each species andgroup of species is continuous in time for the exceptions to the ruleare so few that they may fairly be attributed to our not having asyet discovered in an intermediate deposit the forms which are thereinabsent but which occur above and below so in space it certainly isthe general rule that the area inhabited by a single species or by agroup of species is continuous and the exceptions which are not rare may as i have attempted to show be accounted for by migration atsome former period under different conditions or by occasional means oftransport and by the species having become extinct in the intermediatetracts both in time and space species and groups of species have theirpoints of maximum development groups of species belonging either to acertain period of time or to a certain area are often characterised bytrifling characters in common as of sculpture or colour in lookingto the long succession of ages as in now looking to distant provincesthroughout the world we find that some organisms differ little whilstothers belonging to a different class or to a different order or evenonly to a different family of the same order differ greatly in bothtime and space the lower members of each class generally change lessthan the higher but there are in both cases marked exceptions to therule on my theory these several relations throughout time and spaceare intelligible for whether we look to the forms of life which havechanged during successive ages within the same quarter of the world orto those which have changed after having migrated into distant quarters in both cases the forms within each class have been connected by thesame bond of ordinary generation and the more nearly any two forms arerelated in blood the nearer they will generally stand to each other intime and space in both cases the laws of variation have been the same and modifications have been accumulated by the same power of naturalselection mutual affinities of organic beings morphology embryology rudimentary organs classification

embryology laws of explained by variations not superveningat an early age and being inherited at a corresponding age rudimentaryorgans their origin explained summary from the first dawn of life all organic beings are found to resembleeach other in descending degrees so that they can be classed in groupsunder groups this classification is evidently not arbitrary like thegrouping of the stars in constellations the existence of groups wouldhave been of simple signification if one group had been exclusivelyfitted to inhabit the land and another the water one to feed on flesh another on vegetable matter and so on but the case is widely differentin nature for it is notorious how commonly members of even the samesubgroup have different habits in our second and fourth chapters onvariation and on natural selection i have attempted to show that it isthe widely ranging the much diffused and common that is the dominantspecies belonging to the larger genera which vary most the varieties or incipient species thus produced ultimately become converted as ibelieve into new and distinct species and these on the principleof inheritance tend to produce other new and dominant species consequently the groups which are now large and which generally includemany dominant species tend to go on increasing indefinitely in size i further attempted to show that from the varying descendants of eachspecies trying to occupy as many and as different places as possible inthe economy of nature there is a constant tendency in their charactersto diverge this conclusion was supported by looking at the greatdiversity of the forms of life which in any small area come into theclosest competition and by looking to certain facts in naturalisation i attempted also to show that there is a constant tendency in the formswhich are increasing in number and diverging in character to supplantand exterminate the less divergent the less improved and precedingforms i request the reader to turn to the diagram illustrating theaction as formerly explained of these several principles and hewill see that the inevitable result is that the modified descendantsproceeding from one progenitor become broken up into groups subordinateto groups in the diagram each letter on the uppermost line mayrepresent a genus including several species and all the genera on thisline form together one class for all have descended from one ancientbut unseen parent and consequently have inherited something incommon but the three genera on the left hand have on this sameprinciple much in common and form a sub family distinct from thatincluding the next two genera on the right hand which diverged from acommon parent at the fifth stage of descent these five genera have alsomuch though less in common and they form a family distinct fromthat including the three genera still further to the right hand whichdiverged at a still earlier period and all these genera descended from a form an order distinct from the genera descended from i so thatwe here have many species descended from a single progenitor groupedinto genera and the genera are included in or subordinate to sub families families and orders all united into one class thus thegrand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group which from its familiarity does not always sufficiently strike us isin my judgment fully explained naturalists try to arrange the species genera and families in eachclass on what is called the natural system but what is meant bythis system some authors look at it merely as a scheme for arrangingtogether those living objects which are most alike and for separatingthose which are most unlike or as an artificial means for enunciating as briefly as possible general propositions that is by one sentenceto give the characters common for instance to all mammals by anotherthose common to all carnivora by another those common to the dog genus and then by adding a single sentence a full description is givenof each kind of dog the ingenuity and utility of this system areindisputable but many naturalists think that something more is meantby the natural system they believe that it reveals the plan of thecreator but unless it be specified whether order in time or space or what else is meant by the plan of the creator it seems to me thatnothing is thus added to our knowledge such expressions as thatfamous one of linnaeus and which we often meet with in a more or lessconcealed form that the characters do not make the genus but thatthe genus gives the characters seem to imply that something more isincluded in our classification than mere resemblance i believe thatsomething more is included and that propinquity of descent the onlyknown cause of the similarity of organic beings is the bond hidden asit is by various degrees of modification which is partially revealed tous by our classifications let us now consider the rules followed in classification and thedifficulties which are encountered on the view that classificationeither gives some unknown plan of creation or is simply a scheme forenunciating general propositions and of placing together the forms mostlike each other it might have been thought and was in ancient timesthought that those parts of the structure which determined the habitsof life and the general place of each being in the economy of nature would be of very high importance in classification nothing can be morefalse no one regards the external similarity of a mouse to a shrew ofa dugong to a whale of a whale to a fish as of any importance theseresemblances though so intimately connected with the whole life of thebeing are ranked as merely adaptive or analogical characters but tothe consideration of these resemblances we shall have to recur itmay even be given as a general rule that the less any part of theorganisation is concerned with special habits the more important itbecomes for classification as an instance owen in speaking of thedugong says the generative organs being those which are most remotelyrelated to the habits and food of an animal i have always regarded asaffording very clear indications of its true affinities we are leastlikely in the modifications of these organs to mistake a merely adaptivefor an essential character so with plants how remarkable it is thatthe organs of vegetation on which their whole life depends are oflittle signification excepting in the first main divisions whereas theorgans of reproduction with their product the seed are of paramountimportance we must not therefore in classifying trust to resemblances in partsof the organisation however important they may be for the welfare ofthe being in relation to the outer world perhaps from this cause it haspartly arisen that almost all naturalists lay the greatest stress onresemblances in organs of high vital or physiological importance nodoubt this view of the classificatory importance of organs whichare important is generally but by no means always true but theirimportance for classification i believe depends on their greaterconstancy throughout large groups of species and this constancy dependson such organs having generally been subjected to less change in theadaptation of the species to their conditions of life that themere physiological importance of an organ does not determine itsclassificatory value is almost shown by the one fact that in alliedgroups in which the same organ as we have every reason to suppose hasnearly the same physiological value its classificatory value is widelydifferent no naturalist can have worked at any group without beingstruck with this fact and it has been most fully acknowledged in thewritings of almost every author it will suffice to quote the highestauthority robert brown who in speaking of certain organs in theproteaceae says their generic importance like that of all theirparts not only in this but as i apprehend in every natural family is very unequal and in some cases seems to be entirely lost again inanother work he says the genera of the connaraceae differ in havingone or more ovaria in the existence or absence of albumen in theimbricate or valvular aestivation any one of these characters singlyis frequently of more than generic importance though here even whenall taken together they appear insufficient to separate cnestis fromconnarus to give an example amongst insects in one great divisionof the hymenoptera the antennae as westwood has remarked are mostconstant in structure in another division they differ much and thedifferences are of quite subordinate value in classification yet no oneprobably will say that the antennae in these two divisions of the sameorder are of unequal physiological importance any number of instancescould be given of the varying importance for classification of the sameimportant organ within the same group of beings again no one will say that rudimentary or atrophied organs are of highphysiological or vital importance yet undoubtedly organs in thiscondition are often of high value in classification no one will disputethat the rudimentary teeth in the upper jaws of young ruminants and certain rudimentary bones of the leg are highly serviceable inexhibiting the close affinity between ruminants and pachyderms robertbrown has strongly insisted on the fact that the rudimentary florets areof the highest importance in the classification of the grasses numerous instances could be given of characters derived from parts whichmust be considered of very trifling physiological importance but whichare universally admitted as highly serviceable in the definition ofwhole groups for instance whether or not there is an open passage fromthe nostrils to the mouth the only character according to owen whichabsolutely distinguishes fishes and reptiles the inflection of theangle of the jaws in marsupials the manner in which the wings ofinsects are folded mere colour in certain algae mere pubescence onparts of the flower in grasses the nature of the dermal covering ashair or feathers in the vertebrata if the ornithorhynchus had beencovered with feathers instead of hair this external and triflingcharacter would i think have been considered by naturalists asimportant an aid in determining the degree of affinity of this strangecreature to birds and reptiles as an approach in structure in any oneinternal and important organ the importance for classification of trifling characters mainlydepends on their being correlated with several other characters of moreor less importance the value indeed of an aggregate of characters isvery evident in natural history hence as has often been remarked aspecies may depart from its allies in several characters both of highphysiological importance and of almost universal prevalence and yetleave us in no doubt where it should be ranked hence also it has beenfound that a classification founded on any single character however important that may be has always failed for no part of theorganisation is universally constant the importance of an aggregate ofcharacters even when none are important alone explains i think thatsaying of linnaeus that the characters do not give the genus butthe genus gives the characters for this saying seems founded on anappreciation of many trifling points of resemblance too slight to bedefined certain plants belonging to the malpighiaceae bear perfectand degraded flowers in the latter as a de jussieu has remarked thegreater number of the characters proper to the species to the genus to the family to the class disappear and thus laugh at ourclassification but when aspicarpa produced in france during severalyears only degraded flowers departing so wonderfully in a numberof the most important points of structure from the proper type of theorder yet m richard sagaciously saw as jussieu observes that thisgenus should still be retained amongst the malpighiaceae this caseseems to me well to illustrate the spirit with which our classificationsare sometimes necessarily founded practically when naturalists are at work they do not trouble themselvesabout the physiological value of the characters which they use indefining a group or in allocating any particular species if they finda character nearly uniform and common to a great number of forms andnot common to others they use it as one of high value if common tosome lesser number they use it as of subordinate value this principlehas been broadly confessed by some naturalists to be the true one andby none more clearly than by that excellent botanist aug st hilaire if certain characters are always found correlated with others thoughno apparent bond of connexion can be discovered between them especialvalue is set on them as in most groups of animals important organs such as those for propelling the blood or for aerating it or those forpropagating the race are found nearly uniform they are considered ashighly serviceable in classification but in some groups of animals allthese the most important vital organs are found to offer characters ofquite subordinate value we can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equalimportance with those derived from the adult for our classifications ofcourse include all ages of each species but it is by no means obvious on the ordinary view why the structure of the embryo should be moreimportant for this purpose than that of the adult which alone plays itsfull part in the economy of nature yet it has been strongly urgedby those great naturalists milne edwards and agassiz that embryoniccharacters are the most important of any in the classification ofanimals and this doctrine has very generally been admitted as true the same fact holds good with flowering plants of which the two maindivisions have been founded on characters derived from the embryo onthe number and position of the embryonic leaves or cotyledons and onthe mode of development of the plumule and radicle in our discussionon embryology we shall see why such characters are so valuable on theview of classification tacitly including the idea of descent our classifications are often plainly influenced by chains ofaffinities nothing can be easier than to define a number of characterscommon to all birds but in the case of crustaceans such definition hashitherto been found impossible there are crustaceans at the oppositeends of the series which have hardly a character in common yet thespecies at both ends from being plainly allied to others and these toothers and so onwards can be recognised as unequivocally belonging tothis and to no other class of the articulata geographical distribution has often been used though perhaps not quitelogically in classification more especially in very large groups ofclosely allied forms temminck insists on the utility or even necessityof this practice in certain groups of birds and it has been followed byseveral entomologists and botanists finally with respect to the comparative value of the various groups ofspecies such as orders sub orders families sub families and genera they seem to be at least at present almost arbitrary several of thebest botanists such as mr bentham and others have strongly insistedon their arbitrary value instances could be given amongst plants andinsects of a group of forms first ranked by practised naturalists asonly a genus and then raised to the rank of a sub family or family andthis has been done not because further research has detected importantstructural differences at first overlooked but because numerousallied species with slightly different grades of difference have beensubsequently discovered all the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classificationare explained if i do not greatly deceive myself on the view thatthe natural system is founded on descent with modification that thecharacters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity betweenany two or more species are those which have been inherited from acommon parent and in so far all true classification is genealogical that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have beenunconsciously seeking and not some unknown plan of creation or theenunciation of general propositions and the mere putting together andseparating objects more or less alike but i must explain my meaning more fully i believe that the arrangementof the groups within each class in due subordination and relation tothe other groups must be strictly genealogical in order to be natural but that the amount of difference in the several branches or groups though allied in the same degree in blood to their common progenitor may differ greatly being due to the different degrees of modificationwhich they have undergone and this is expressed by the forms beingranked under different genera families sections or orders the readerwill best understand what is meant if he will take the trouble ofreferring to the diagram in the fourth chapter we will suppose theletters a to l to represent allied genera which lived during thesilurian epoch and these have descended from a species which existed atan unknown anterior period species of three of these genera a f andi have transmitted modified descendants to the present day representedby the fifteen genera a to z on the uppermost horizontal line nowall these modified descendants from a single species are represented asrelated in blood or descent to the same degree they may metaphoricallybe called cousins to the same millionth degree yet they differ widelyand in different degrees from each other the forms descended from a now broken up into two or three families constitute a distinct orderfrom those descended from i also broken up into two families nor canthe existing species descended from a be ranked in the same genus withthe parent a or those from i with the parent i but the existing genusf may be supposed to have been but slightly modified and it willthen rank with the parent genus f just as some few still living organicbeings belong to silurian genera so that the amount or value of thedifferences between organic beings all related to each other in the samedegree in blood has come to be widely different nevertheless theirgenealogical arrangement remains strictly true not only at the presenttime but at each successive period of descent all the modifieddescendants from a will have inherited something in common from theircommon parent as will all the descendants from i so will it be witheach subordinate branch of descendants at each successive period if however we choose to suppose that any of the descendants of a or ofi have been so much modified as to have more or less completely losttraces of their parentage in this case their places in a naturalclassification will have been more or less completely lost assometimes seems to have occurred with existing organisms all thedescendants of the genus f along its whole line of descent aresupposed to have been but little modified and they yet form a singlegenus but this genus though much isolated will still occupy itsproper intermediate position for f originally was intermediate incharacter between a and i and the several genera descended from thesetwo genera will have inherited to a certain extent their characters this natural arrangement is shown as far as is possible on paper inthe diagram but in much too simple a manner if a branching diagram hadnot been used and only the names of the groups had been written in alinear series it would have been still less possible to have given anatural arrangement and it is notoriously not possible to represent ina series on a flat surface the affinities which we discover in natureamongst the beings of the same group thus on the view which i hold the natural system is genealogical in its arrangement like a pedigree but the degrees of modification which the different groups haveundergone have to be expressed by ranking them under differentso called genera sub families families sections orders and classes it may be worth while to illustrate this view of classification bytaking the case of languages if we possessed a perfect pedigree ofmankind a genealogical arrangement of the races of man would afford thebest classification of the various languages now spoken throughout theworld and if all extinct languages and all intermediate and slowlychanging dialects had to be included such an arrangement would ithink be the only possible one yet it might be that some very ancientlanguage had altered little and had given rise to few new languages whilst others owing to the spreading and subsequent isolation andstates of civilisation of the several races descended from a commonrace had altered much and had given rise to many new languages anddialects the various degrees of difference in the languages from thesame stock would have to be expressed by groups subordinate togroups but the proper or even only possible arrangement would still begenealogical and this would be strictly natural as it would connecttogether all languages extinct and modern by the closest affinities and would give the filiation and origin of each tongue in confirmation of this view let us glance at the classificationof varieties which are believed or known to have descended from onespecies these are grouped under species with sub varieties undervarieties and with our domestic productions several other grades ofdifference are requisite as we have seen with pigeons the originof the existence of groups subordinate to groups is the same withvarieties as with species namely closeness of descent with variousdegrees of modification nearly the same rules are followed inclassifying varieties as with species authors have insisted on thenecessity of classing varieties on a natural instead of an artificialsystem we are cautioned for instance not to class two varieties ofthe pine apple together merely because their fruit though the mostimportant part happens to be nearly identical no one puts the swedishand common turnips together though the esculent and thickened stemsare so similar whatever part is found to be most constant is used inclassing varieties thus the great agriculturist marshall says the hornsare very useful for this purpose with cattle because they are lessvariable than the shape or colour of the body etc whereas with sheepthe horns are much less serviceable because less constant in classingvarieties i apprehend if we had a real pedigree a genealogicalclassification would be universally preferred and it has been attemptedby some authors for we might feel sure whether there had been moreor less modification the principle of inheritance would keep the formstogether which were allied in the greatest number of points in tumblerpigeons though some sub varieties differ from the others in theimportant character of having a longer beak yet all are kept togetherfrom having the common habit of tumbling but the short faced breed hasnearly or quite lost this habit nevertheless without any reasoningor thinking on the subject these tumblers are kept in the same group because allied in blood and alike in some other respects if it could beproved that the hottentot had descended from the negro i think he wouldbe classed under the negro group however much he might differ in colourand other important characters from negroes with species in a state of nature every naturalist has in fact broughtdescent into his classification for he includes in his lowest grade or that of a species the two sexes and how enormously these sometimesdiffer in the most important characters is known to every naturalist scarcely a single fact can be predicated in common of the males andhermaphrodites of certain cirripedes when adult and yet no one dreamsof separating them the naturalist includes as one species the severallarval stages of the same individual however much they may differ fromeach other and from the adult as he likewise includes the so calledalternate generations of steenstrup which can only in a technical sensebe considered as the same individual he includes monsters he includesvarieties not solely because they closely resemble the parent form butbecause they are descended from it he who believes that the cowslipis descended from the primrose or conversely ranks them together asa single species and gives a single definition as soon as threeorchidean forms monochanthus myanthus and catasetum which hadpreviously been ranked as three distinct genera were known to besometimes produced on the same spike they were immediately included asa single species but it may be asked what ought we to do if it couldbe proved that one species of kangaroo had been produced by a longcourse of modification from a bear ought we to rank this onespecies with bears and what should we do with the other species the supposition is of course preposterous and i might answer by theargumentum ad hominem and ask what should be done if a perfect kangaroowere seen to come out of the womb of a bear according to all analogy it would be ranked with bears but then assuredly all the other speciesof the kangaroo family would have to be classed under the bear genus the whole case is preposterous for where there has been close descentin common there will certainly be close resemblance or affinity as descent has universally been used in classing together theindividuals of the same species though the males and females and larvaeare sometimes extremely different and as it has been used in classingvarieties which have undergone a certain and sometimes a considerableamount of modification may not this same element of descent have beenunconsciously used in grouping species under genera and genera underhigher groups though in these cases the modification has been greaterin degree and has taken a longer time to complete i believe it hasthus been unconsciously used and only thus can i understand the severalrules and guides which have been followed by our best systematists wehave no written pedigrees we have to make out community of descent byresemblances of any kind therefore we choose those characters which as far as we can judge are the least likely to have been modifiedin relation to the conditions of life to which each species has beenrecently exposed rudimentary structures on this view are as good as oreven sometimes better than other parts of the organisation we care nothow trifling a character may be let it be the mere inflection ofthe angle of the jaw the manner in which an insect s wing is folded whether the skin be covered by hair or feathers if it prevailthroughout many and different species especially those having verydifferent habits of life it assumes high value for we can account forits presence in so many forms with such different habits only by itsinheritance from a common parent we may err in this respect in regardto single points of structure but when several characters let thembe ever so trifling occur together throughout a large group of beingshaving different habits we may feel almost sure on the theory ofdescent that these characters have been inherited from a commonancestor and we know that such correlated or aggregated characters haveespecial value in classification we can understand why a species or a group of species may depart inseveral of its most important characteristics from its allies and yetbe safely classed with them this may be safely done and is oftendone as long as a sufficient number of characters let them be ever sounimportant betrays the hidden bond of community of descent let twoforms have not a single character in common yet if these extreme formsare connected together by a chain of intermediate groups we may atonce infer their community of descent and we put them all into the sameclass as we find organs of high physiological importance thosewhich serve to preserve life under the most diverse conditions ofexistence are generally the most constant we attach especial value tothem but if these same organs in another group or section of agroup are found to differ much we at once value them less inour classification we shall hereafter i think clearly see whyembryological characters are of such high classificatory importance geographical distribution may sometimes be brought usefully into play inclassing large and widely distributed genera because all the species ofthe same genus inhabiting any distinct and isolated region have in allprobability descended from the same parents we can understand on these views the very important distinctionbetween real affinities and analogical or adaptive resemblances lamarck first called attention to this distinction and he has been ablyfollowed by macleay and others the resemblance in the shape of thebody and in the fin like anterior limbs between the dugong which is apachydermatous animal and the whale and between both these mammals andfishes is analogical amongst insects there are innumerable instances thus linnaeus misled by external appearances actually classed anhomopterous insect as a moth we see something of the same kind evenin our domestic varieties as in the thickened stems of the common andswedish turnip the resemblance of the greyhound and racehorse is hardlymore fanciful than the analogies which have been drawn by some authorsbetween very distinct animals on my view of characters being of realimportance for classification only in so far as they reveal descent wecan clearly understand why analogical or adaptive character although ofthe utmost importance to the welfare of the being are almost valuelessto the systematist for animals belonging to two most distinct linesof descent may readily become adapted to similar conditions and thusassume a close external resemblance but such resemblances will notreveal will rather tend to conceal their blood relationship to theirproper lines of descent we can also understand the apparent paradox that the very same characters are analogical when one class or order iscompared with another but give true affinities when the members of thesame class or order are compared one with another thus the shape ofthe body and fin like limbs are only analogical when whales are comparedwith fishes being adaptations in both classes for swimming through thewater but the shape of the body and fin like limbs serve as charactersexhibiting true affinity between the several members of the whalefamily for these cetaceans agree in so many characters great andsmall that we cannot doubt that they have inherited their general shapeof body and structure of limbs from a common ancestor so it is withfishes as members of distinct classes have often been adapted by successiveslight modifications to live under nearly similar circumstances toinhabit for instance the three elements of land air and water we canperhaps understand how it is that a numerical parallelism has sometimesbeen observed between the sub groups in distinct classes a naturalist struck by a parallelism of this nature in any one class by arbitrarilyraising or sinking the value of the groups in other classes and all ourexperience shows that this valuation has hitherto been arbitrary couldeasily extend the parallelism over a wide range and thus the septenary quinary quaternary and ternary classifications have probably arisen as the modified descendants of dominant species belonging to the largergenera tend to inherit the advantages which made the groups to whichthey belong large and their parents dominant they are almost sure tospread widely and to seize on more and more places in the economyof nature the larger and more dominant groups thus tend to go onincreasing in size and they consequently supplant many smaller andfeebler groups thus we can account for the fact that all organisms recent and extinct are included under a few great orders under stillfewer classes and all in one great natural system as showing howfew the higher groups are in number and how widely spread they arethroughout the world the fact is striking that the discovery ofaustralia has not added a single insect belonging to a new order andthat in the vegetable kingdom as i learn from dr hooker it has addedonly two or three orders of small size in the chapter on geological succession i attempted to show on theprinciple of each group having generally diverged much in characterduring the long continued process of modification how it is that themore ancient forms of life often present characters in some slightdegree intermediate between existing groups a few old and intermediateparent forms having occasionally transmitted to the present daydescendants but little modified will give to us our so called osculantor aberrant groups the more aberrant any form is the greater must bethe number of connecting forms which on my theory have been exterminatedand utterly lost and we have some evidence of aberrant forms havingsuffered severely from extinction for they are generally represented byextremely few species and such species as do occur are generally verydistinct from each other which again implies extinction the generaornithorhynchus and lepidosiren for example would not have been lessaberrant had each been represented by a dozen species instead of bya single one but such richness in species as i find after someinvestigation does not commonly fall to the lot of aberrant genera wecan i think account for this fact only by looking at aberrant formsas failing groups conquered by more successful competitors with afew members preserved by some unusual coincidence of favourablecircumstances mr waterhouse has remarked that when a member belonging to one groupof animals exhibits an affinity to a quite distinct group this affinityin most cases is general and not special thus according to mr waterhouse of all rodents the bizcacha is most nearly related tomarsupials but in the points in which it approaches this order itsrelations are general and not to any one marsupial species more thanto another as the points of affinity of the bizcacha to marsupials arebelieved to be real and not merely adaptive they are due on my theoryto inheritance in common therefore we must suppose either that allrodents including the bizcacha branched off from some very ancientmarsupial which will have had a character in some degree intermediatewith respect to all existing marsupials or that both rodents andmarsupials branched off from a common progenitor and that both groupshave since undergone much modification in divergent directions on either view we may suppose that the bizcacha has retained byinheritance more of the character of its ancient progenitor than haveother rodents and therefore it will not be specially related to any oneexisting marsupial but indirectly to all or nearly all marsupials fromhaving partially retained the character of their common progenitor orof an early member of the group on the other hand of all marsupials as mr waterhouse has remarked the phascolomys resembles most nearly not any one species but the general order of rodents in this case however it may be strongly suspected that the resemblance is onlyanalogical owing to the phascolomys having become adapted to habitslike those of a rodent the elder de candolle has made nearly similarobservations on the general nature of the affinities of distinct ordersof plants on the principle of the multiplication and gradual divergence incharacter of the species descended from a common parent together withtheir retention by inheritance of some characters in common we canunderstand the excessively complex and radiating affinities by which allthe members of the same family or higher group are connected together for the common parent of a whole family of species now broken up byextinction into distinct groups and sub groups will have transmittedsome of its characters modified in various ways and degrees to all and the several species will consequently be related to each other bycircuitous lines of affinity of various lengths as may be seen in thediagram so often referred to mounting up through many predecessors as it is difficult to show the blood relationship between thenumerous kindred of any ancient and noble family even by the aid of agenealogical tree and almost impossible to do this without this aid we can understand the extraordinary difficulty which naturalists haveexperienced in describing without the aid of a diagram the variousaffinities which they perceive between the many living and extinctmembers of the same great natural class extinction as we have seen in the fourth chapter has played animportant part in defining and widening the intervals between theseveral groups in each class we may thus account even for thedistinctness of whole classes from each other for instance of birdsfrom all other vertebrate animals by the belief that many ancient formsof life have been utterly lost through which the early progenitors ofbirds were formerly connected with the early progenitors of the othervertebrate classes there has been less entire extinction of the formsof life which once connected fishes with batrachians there has beenstill less in some other classes as in that of the crustacea for herethe most wonderfully diverse forms are still tied together by a long but broken chain of affinities extinction has only separated groups it has by no means made them for if every form which has ever livedon this earth were suddenly to reappear though it would bequite impossible to give definitions by which each group could bedistinguished from other groups as all would blend together by stepsas fine as those between the finest existing varieties neverthelessa natural classification or at least a natural arrangement would bepossible we shall see this by turning to the diagram the letters ato l may represent eleven silurian genera some of which have producedlarge groups of modified descendants every intermediate link betweenthese eleven genera and their primordial parent and every intermediatelink in each branch and sub branch of their descendants may be supposedto be still alive and the links to be as fine as those between thefinest varieties in this case it would be quite impossible to give anydefinition by which the several members of the several groups could bedistinguished from their more immediate parents or these parents fromtheir ancient and unknown progenitor yet the natural arrangement in thediagram would still hold good and on the principle of inheritance allthe forms descended from a or from i would have something in common in a tree we can specify this or that branch though at the actual forkthe two unite and blend together we could not as i have said definethe several groups but we could pick out types or forms representingmost of the characters of each group whether large or small and thusgive a general idea of the value of the differences between them thisis what we should be driven to if we were ever to succeed in collectingall the forms in any class which have lived throughout all timeand space we shall certainly never succeed in making so perfect acollection nevertheless in certain classes we are tending in thisdirection and milne edwards has lately insisted in an able paper onthe high importance of looking to types whether or not we can separateand define the groups to which such types belong finally we have seen that natural selection which results from thestruggle for existence and which almost inevitably induces extinctionand divergence of character in the many descendants from one dominantparent species explains that great and universal feature in theaffinities of all organic beings namely their subordination in groupunder group we use the element of descent in classing the individualsof both sexes and of all ages although having few characters in common under one species we use descent in classing acknowledged varieties however different they may be from their parent and i believe thiselement of descent is the hidden bond of connexion which naturalistshave sought under the term of the natural system on this idea of thenatural system being in so far as it has been perfected genealogicalin its arrangement with the grades of difference between thedescendants from a common parent expressed by the terms genera families orders etc we can understand the rules which we arecompelled to follow in our classification we can understand why wevalue certain resemblances far more than others why we are permitted touse rudimentary and useless organs or others of trifling physiologicalimportance why in comparing one group with a distinct group wesummarily reject analogical or adaptive characters and yet use thesesame characters within the limits of the same group we can clearly seehow it is that all living and extinct forms can be grouped togetherin one great system and how the several members of each classare connected together by the most complex and radiating lines ofaffinities we shall never probably disentangle the inextricable webof affinities between the members of any one class but when we havea distinct object in view and do not look to some unknown plan ofcreation we may hope to make sure but slow progress morphology we have seen that the members of the same class independently oftheir habits of life resemble each other in the general plan of theirorganisation this resemblance is often expressed by the term unity oftype or by saying that the several parts and organs in the differentspecies of the class are homologous the whole subject is included underthe general name of morphology this is the most interesting departmentof natural history and may be said to be its very soul what can bemore curious than that the hand of a man formed for grasping that of amole for digging the leg of the horse the paddle of the porpoise andthe wing of the bat should all be constructed on the same pattern andshould include the same bones in the same relative positions geoffroyst hilaire has insisted strongly on the high importance of relativeconnexion in homologous organs the parts may change to almost anyextent in form and size and yet they always remain connected togetherin the same order we never find for instance the bones of the arm andforearm or of the thigh and leg transposed hence the same names canbe given to the homologous bones in widely different animals we see thesame great law in the construction of the mouths of insects what canbe more different than the immensely long spiral proboscis of asphinx moth the curious folded one of a bee or bug and the great jawsof a beetle yet all these organs serving for such different purposes are formed by infinitely numerous modifications of an upper lip mandibles and two pairs of maxillae analogous laws govern theconstruction of the mouths and limbs of crustaceans so it is with theflowers of plants nothing can be more hopeless than to attempt to explain this similarityof pattern in members of the same class by utility or by the doctrineof final causes the hopelessness of the attempt has been expresslyadmitted by owen in his most interesting work on the nature of limbs on the ordinary view of the independent creation of each being we canonly say that so it is that it has so pleased the creator to constructeach animal and plant the explanation is manifest on the theory of the natural selection ofsuccessive slight modifications each modification being profitablein some way to the modified form but often affecting by correlation ofgrowth other parts of the organisation in changes of this nature therewill be little or no tendency to modify the original pattern or totranspose parts the bones of a limb might be shortened and widened toany extent and become gradually enveloped in thick membrane so as toserve as a fin or a webbed foot might have all its bones or certainbones lengthened to any extent and the membrane connecting themincreased to any extent so as to serve as a wing yet in all this greatamount of modification there will be no tendency to alter the frameworkof bones or the relative connexion of the several parts if we supposethat the ancient progenitor the archetype as it may be called of allmammals had its limbs constructed on the existing general pattern for whatever purpose they served we can at once perceive the plainsignification of the homologous construction of the limbs throughout thewhole class so with the mouths of insects we have only to suppose thattheir common progenitor had an upper lip mandibles and two pairof maxillae these parts being perhaps very simple in form and thennatural selection will account for the infinite diversity in structureand function of the mouths of insects nevertheless it is conceivablethat the general pattern of an organ might become so much obscured as tobe finally lost by the atrophy and ultimately by the complete abortionof certain parts by the soldering together of other parts and by thedoubling or multiplication of others variations which we know to bewithin the limits of possibility in the paddles of the extinct giganticsea lizards and in the mouths of certain suctorial crustaceans thegeneral pattern seems to have been thus to a certain extent obscured there is another and equally curious branch of the present subject namely the comparison not of the same part in different members of aclass but of the different parts or organs in the same individual most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologouswith that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with theelemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae the anterior andposterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classesare plainly homologous we see the same law in comparing the wonderfullycomplex jaws and legs in crustaceans it is familiar to almost everyone that in a flower the relative position of the sepals petals stamens and pistils as well as their intimate structure areintelligible on the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves arranged in a spire in monstrous plants we often get direct evidenceof the possibility of one organ being transformed into another and wecan actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals andin flowers that organs which when mature become extremely different are at an early stage of growth exactly alike how inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation whyshould the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and suchextraordinarily shaped pieces of bone as owen has remarked thebenefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act ofparturition of mammals will by no means explain the same constructionin the skulls of birds why should similar bones have been created inthe formation of the wing and leg of a bat used as they are for suchtotally different purposes why should one crustacean which has anextremely complex mouth formed of many parts consequently always havefewer legs or conversely those with many legs have simpler mouths why should the sepals petals stamens and pistils in any individualflower though fitted for such widely different purposes be allconstructed on the same pattern on the theory of natural selection we can satisfactorily answer thesequestions in the vertebrata we see a series of internal vertebraebearing certain processes and appendages in the articulata we see thebody divided into a series of segments bearing external appendages and in flowering plants we see a series of successive spiral whorls ofleaves an indefinite repetition of the same part or organ is the commoncharacteristic as owen has observed of all low or little modifiedforms therefore we may readily believe that the unknown progenitor ofthe vertebrata possessed many vertebrae the unknown progenitor ofthe articulata many segments and the unknown progenitor of floweringplants many spiral whorls of leaves we have formerly seen thatparts many times repeated are eminently liable to vary in number andstructure consequently it is quite probable that natural selection during a long continued course of modification should have seized ona certain number of the primordially similar elements many timesrepeated and have adapted them to the most diverse purposes and asthe whole amount of modification will have been effected by slightsuccessive steps we need not wonder at discovering in such parts ororgans a certain degree of fundamental resemblance retained by thestrong principle of inheritance in the great class of molluscs though we can homologise the parts ofone species with those of another and distinct species we can indicatebut few serial homologies that is we are seldom enabled to say thatone part or organ is homologous with another in the same individual andwe can understand this fact for in molluscs even in the lowest membersof the class we do not find nearly so much indefinite repetition ofany one part as we find in the other great classes of the animal andvegetable kingdoms naturalists frequently speak of the skull as formed of metamorphosedvertebrae the jaws of crabs as metamorphosed legs the stamens andpistils of flowers as metamorphosed leaves but it would in these casesprobably be more correct as professor huxley has remarked to speakof both skull and vertebrae both jaws and legs etc as having beenmetamorphosed not one from the other but from some common element naturalists however use such language only in a metaphorical sense they are far from meaning that during a long course of descent primordial organs of any kind vertebrae in the one case and legs in theother have actually been modified into skulls or jaws yet so strongis the appearance of a modification of this nature having occurred that naturalists can hardly avoid employing language having this plainsignification on my view these terms may be used literally and thewonderful fact of the jaws for instance of a crab retaining numerouscharacters which they would probably have retained through inheritance if they had really been metamorphosed during a long course of descentfrom true legs or from some simple appendage is explained embryology it has already been casually remarked that certain organs in theindividual which when mature become widely different and serve fordifferent purposes are in the embryo exactly alike the embryos also of distinct animals within the same class are often strikingly similar a better proof of this cannot be given than a circumstance mentionedby agassiz namely that having forgotten to ticket the embryo of somevertebrate animal he cannot now tell whether it be that of a mammal bird or reptile the vermiform larvae of moths flies beetles etc resemble each other much more closely than do the mature insects butin the case of larvae the embryos are active and have been adaptedfor special lines of life a trace of the law of embryonic resemblance sometimes lasts till a rather late age thus birds of the same genus and of closely allied genera often resemble each other in their firstand second plumage as we see in the spotted feathers in the thrushgroup in the cat tribe most of the species are striped or spottedin lines and stripes can be plainly distinguished in the whelp ofthe lion we occasionally though rarely see something of this kind inplants thus the embryonic leaves of the ulex or furze and the firstleaves of the phyllodineous acaceas are pinnate or divided like theordinary leaves of the leguminosae the points of structure in which the embryos of widely differentanimals of the same class resemble each other often have no directrelation to their conditions of existence we cannot for instance suppose that in the embryos of the vertebrata the peculiar loop likecourse of the arteries near the branchial slits are related to similarconditions in the young mammal which is nourished in the womb of itsmother in the egg of the bird which is hatched in a nest and in thespawn of a frog under water we have no more reason to believe in sucha relation than we have to believe that the same bones in the hand ofa man wing of a bat and fin of a porpoise are related to similarconditions of life no one will suppose that the stripes on the whelpof a lion or the spots on the young blackbird are of any use to theseanimals or are related to the conditions to which they are exposed the case however is different when an animal during any part of itsembryonic career is active and has to provide for itself the period ofactivity may come on earlier or later in life but whenever it comes on the adaptation of the larva to its conditions of life is just as perfectand as beautiful as in the adult animal from such special adaptations the similarity of the larvae or active embryos of allied animals issometimes much obscured and cases could be given of the larvae of twospecies or of two groups of species differing quite as much oreven more from each other than do their adult parents in most cases however the larvae though active still obey more or less closely thelaw of common embryonic resemblance cirripedes afford a good instanceof this even the illustrious cuvier did not perceive that a barnaclewas as it certainly is a crustacean but a glance at the larva showsthis to be the case in an unmistakeable manner so again the two maindivisions of cirripedes the pedunculated and sessile which differwidely in external appearance have larvae in all their several stagesbarely distinguishable the embryo in the course of development generally rises in organisation i use this expression though i am aware that it is hardly possible todefine clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower but no one probably will dispute that the butterfly is higher than thecaterpillar in some cases however the mature animal is generallyconsidered as lower in the scale than the larva as with certainparasitic crustaceans to refer once again to cirripedes the larvae inthe first stage have three pairs of legs a very simple single eye anda probosciformed mouth with which they feed largely for they increasemuch in size in the second stage answering to the chrysalis stage ofbutterflies they have six pairs of beautifully constructed natatorylegs a pair of magnificent compound eyes and extremely complexantennae but they have a closed and imperfect mouth and cannot feed their function at this stage is to search by their well developedorgans of sense and to reach by their active powers of swimming aproper place on which to become attached and to undergo their finalmetamorphosis when this is completed they are fixed for life theirlegs are now converted into prehensile organs they again obtain awell constructed mouth but they have no antennae and their two eyesare now reconverted into a minute single and very simple eye spot in this last and complete state cirripedes may be considered aseither more highly or more lowly organised than they were in the larvalcondition but in some genera the larvae become developed either intohermaphrodites having the ordinary structure or into what i have calledcomplemental males and in the latter the development has assuredlybeen retrograde for the male is a mere sack which lives for a shorttime and is destitute of mouth stomach or other organ of importance excepting for reproduction we are so much accustomed to see differences in structure between theembryo and the adult and likewise a close similarity in the embryos ofwidely different animals within the same class that we might be led tolook at these facts as necessarily contingent in some manner on growth but there is no obvious reason why for instance the wing of a bat orthe fin of a porpoise should not have been sketched out with all theparts in proper proportion as soon as any structure became visible inthe embryo and in some whole groups of animals and in certain membersof other groups the embryo does not at any period differ widely fromthe adult thus owen has remarked in regard to cuttle fish there is nometamorphosis the cephalopodic character is manifested long beforethe parts of the embryo are completed and again in spiders thereis nothing worthy to be called a metamorphosis the larvae of insects whether adapted to the most diverse and active habits or quiteinactive being fed by their parents or placed in the midst of propernutriment yet nearly all pass through a similar worm like stage ofdevelopment but in some few cases as in that of aphis if we look tothe admirable drawings by professor huxley of the development of thisinsect we see no trace of the vermiform stage how then can we explain these several facts in embryology namelythe very general but not universal difference in structure between theembryo and the adult of parts in the same individual embryo whichultimately become very unlike and serve for diverse purposes beingat this early period of growth alike of embryos of different specieswithin the same class generally but not universally resembling eachother of the structure of the embryo not being closely related to itsconditions of existence except when the embryo becomes at any periodof life active and has to provide for itself of the embryo apparentlyhaving sometimes a higher organisation than the mature animal intowhich it is developed i believe that all these facts can be explained as follows on the view of descent with modification it is commonly assumed perhaps from monstrosities often affecting theembryo at a very early period that slight variations necessarilyappear at an equally early period but we have little evidence onthis head indeed the evidence rather points the other way for it isnotorious that breeders of cattle horses and various fancy animals cannot positively tell until some time after the animal has been born what its merits or form will ultimately turn out we see this plainly inour own children we cannot always tell whether the child will be tallor short or what its precise features will be the question is not atwhat period of life any variation has been caused but at what periodit is fully displayed the cause may have acted and i believe generallyhas acted even before the embryo is formed and the variation may bedue to the male and female sexual elements having been affected bythe conditions to which either parent or their ancestors have beenexposed nevertheless an effect thus caused at a very early period evenbefore the formation of the embryo may appear late in life as whenan hereditary disease which appears in old age alone has beencommunicated to the offspring from the reproductive element of oneparent or again as when the horns of cross bred cattle have beenaffected by the shape of the horns of either parent for the welfare ofa very young animal as long as it remains in its mother s womb or inthe egg or as long as it is nourished and protected by its parent it must be quite unimportant whether most of its characters are fullyacquired a little earlier or later in life it would not signify forinstance to a bird which obtained its food best by having a long beak whether or not it assumed a beak of this particular length as long asit was fed by its parents hence i conclude that it is quite possible that each of the many successive modifications by which each specieshas acquired its present structure may have supervened at a not veryearly period of life and some direct evidence from our domestic animalssupports this view but in other cases it is quite possible that eachsuccessive modification or most of them may have appeared at anextremely early period i have stated in the first chapter that there is some evidence torender it probable that at whatever age any variation first appearsin the parent it tends to reappear at a corresponding age in theoffspring certain variations can only appear at corresponding ages forinstance peculiarities in the caterpillar cocoon or imago states ofthe silk moth or again in the horns of almost full grown cattle butfurther than this variations which for all that we can see might haveappeared earlier or later in life tend to appear at a correspondingage in the offspring and parent i am far from meaning that this isinvariably the case and i could give a good many cases of variations taking the word in the largest sense which have supervened at anearlier age in the child than in the parent these two principles if their truth be admitted will i believe explain all the above specified leading facts in embryology but firstlet us look at a few analogous cases in domestic varieties some authorswho have written on dogs maintain that the greyhound and bulldog though appearing so different are really varieties most closely allied and have probably descended from the same wild stock hence i wascurious to see how far their puppies differed from each other i wastold by breeders that they differed just as much as their parents andthis judging by the eye seemed almost to be the case but on actuallymeasuring the old dogs and their six days old puppies i found thatthe puppies had not nearly acquired their full amount of proportionaldifference so again i was told that the foals of cart and race horsesdiffered as much as the full grown animals and this surprised megreatly as i think it probable that the difference between these twobreeds has been wholly caused by selection under domestication buthaving had careful measurements made of the dam and of a three days oldcolt of a race and heavy cart horse i find that the colts have by nomeans acquired their full amount of proportional difference as the evidence appears to me conclusive that the several domesticbreeds of pigeon have descended from one wild species i compared youngpigeons of various breeds within twelve hours after being hatched icarefully measured the proportions but will not here give details ofthe beak width of mouth length of nostril and of eyelid size offeet and length of leg in the wild stock in pouters fantails runts barbs dragons carriers and tumblers now some of these birds whenmature differ so extraordinarily in length and form of beak thatthey would i cannot doubt be ranked in distinct genera had they beennatural productions but when the nestling birds of these several breedswere placed in a row though most of them could be distinguished fromeach other yet their proportional differences in the above specifiedseveral points were incomparably less than in the full grown birds somecharacteristic points of difference for instance that of the widthof mouth could hardly be detected in the young but there was oneremarkable exception to this rule for the young of the short facedtumbler differed from the young of the wild rock pigeon and of the otherbreeds in all its proportions almost exactly as much as in the adultstate the two principles above given seem to me to explain these facts inregard to the later embryonic stages of our domestic varieties fanciersselect their horses dogs and pigeons for breeding when they arenearly grown up they are indifferent whether the desired qualitiesand structures have been acquired earlier or later in life if thefull grown animal possesses them and the cases just given moreespecially that of pigeons seem to show that the characteristicdifferences which give value to each breed and which have beenaccumulated by man s selection have not generally first appeared atan early period of life and have been inherited by the offspring at acorresponding not early period but the case of the short faced tumbler which when twelve hours old had acquired its proper proportions proves that this is not the universal rule for here the characteristicdifferences must either have appeared at an earlier period than usual or if not so the differences must have been inherited not at thecorresponding but at an earlier age now let us apply these facts and the above two principles which latter though not proved true can be shown to be in some degree probable tospecies in a state of nature let us take a genus of birds descendedon my theory from some one parent species and of which the several newspecies have become modified through natural selection in accordancewith their diverse habits then from the many slight successive stepsof variation having supervened at a rather late age and having beeninherited at a corresponding age the young of the new species of oursupposed genus will manifestly tend to resemble each other much moreclosely than do the adults just as we have seen in the case ofpigeons we may extend this view to whole families or even classes thefore limbs for instance which served as legs in the parent species may become by a long course of modification adapted in one descendantto act as hands in another as paddles in another as wings and on theabove two principles namely of each successive modification superveningat a rather late age and being inherited at a corresponding lateage the fore limbs in the embryos of the several descendants of theparent species will still resemble each other closely for they will nothave been modified but in each individual new species the embryonicfore limbs will differ greatly from the fore limbs in the mature animal the limbs in the latter having undergone much modification at a ratherlate period of life and having thus been converted into hands orpaddles or wings whatever influence long continued exercise or use onthe one hand and disuse on the other may have in modifying an organ such influence will mainly affect the mature animal which has cometo its full powers of activity and has to gain its own living and theeffects thus produced will be inherited at a corresponding mature age whereas the young will remain unmodified or be modified in a lesserdegree by the effects of use and disuse in certain cases the successive steps of variation might supervene fromcauses of which we are wholly ignorant at a very early period of life or each step might be inherited at an earlier period than that at whichit first appeared in either case as with the short faced tumbler theyoung or embryo would closely resemble the mature parent form we haveseen that this is the rule of development in certain whole groups ofanimals as with cuttle fish and spiders and with a few members of thegreat class of insects as with aphis with respect to the final causeof the young in these cases not undergoing any metamorphosis or closelyresembling their parents from their earliest age we can see that thiswould result from the two following contingencies firstly from theyoung during a course of modification carried on for many generations having to provide for their own wants at a very early stage ofdevelopment and secondly from their following exactly the same habitsof life with their parents for in this case it would be indispensablefor the existence of the species that the child should be modified ata very early age in the same manner with its parents in accordance withtheir similar habits some further explanation however of the embryonot undergoing any metamorphosis is perhaps requisite if on the otherhand it profited the young to follow habits of life in any degreedifferent from those of their parent and consequently to be constructedin a slightly different manner then on the principle of inheritance atcorresponding ages the active young or larvae might easily be renderedby natural selection different to any conceivable extent from theirparents such differences might also become correlated with successivestages of development so that the larvae in the first stage mightdiffer greatly from the larvae in the second stage as we have seen tobe the case with cirripedes the adult might become fitted for sites orhabits in which organs of locomotion or of the senses etc would beuseless and in this case the final metamorphosis would be said to beretrograde as all the organic beings extinct and recent which have ever lived onthis earth have to be classed together and as all have been connectedby the finest gradations the best or indeed if our collections werenearly perfect the only possible arrangement would be genealogical descent being on my view the hidden bond of connexion which naturalistshave been seeking under the term of the natural system on this viewwe can understand how it is that in the eyes of most naturalists thestructure of the embryo is even more important for classification thanthat of the adult for the embryo is the animal in its less modifiedstate and in so far it reveals the structure of its progenitor intwo groups of animal however much they may at present differ from eachother in structure and habits if they pass through the same or similarembryonic stages we may feel assured that they have both descended fromthe same or nearly similar parents and are therefore in that degreeclosely related thus community in embryonic structure revealscommunity of descent it will reveal this community of descent howevermuch the structure of the adult may have been modified and obscured wehave seen for instance that cirripedes can at once be recognised bytheir larvae as belonging to the great class of crustaceans as theembryonic state of each species and group of species partially shows usthe structure of their less modified ancient progenitors we can clearlysee why ancient and extinct forms of life should resemble the embryos oftheir descendants our existing species agassiz believes this to be alaw of nature but i am bound to confess that i only hope to see thelaw hereafter proved true it can be proved true in those cases alone inwhich the ancient state now supposed to be represented in many embryos has not been obliterated either by the successive variations in a longcourse of modification having supervened at a very early age or by thevariations having been inherited at an earlier period than that at whichthey first appeared it should also be borne in mind that the supposedlaw of resemblance of ancient forms of life to the embryonic stages ofrecent forms may be true but yet owing to the geological record notextending far enough back in time may remain for a long period or forever incapable of demonstration thus as it seems to me the leading facts in embryology which aresecond in importance to none in natural history are explained on theprinciple of slight modifications not appearing in the many descendantsfrom some one ancient progenitor at a very early period in the life ofeach though perhaps caused at the earliest and being inherited at acorresponding not early period embryology rises greatly in interest when we thus look at the embryo as a picture more or less obscured ofthe common parent form of each great class of animals rudimentary atrophied or aborted organs organs or parts in this strange condition bearing the stamp ofinutility are extremely common throughout nature for instance rudimentary mammae are very general in the males of mammals i presumethat the bastard wing in birds may be safely considered as a digitin a rudimentary state in very many snakes one lobe of the lungs isrudimentary in other snakes there are rudiments of the pelvis and hindlimbs some of the cases of rudimentary organs are extremely curious for instance the presence of teeth in foetal whales which when grownup have not a tooth in their heads and the presence of teeth whichnever cut through the gums in the upper jaws of our unborn calves ithas even been stated on good authority that rudiments of teeth can bedetected in the beaks of certain embryonic birds nothing can be plainerthan that wings are formed for flight yet in how many insects do we seewings so reduced in size as to be utterly incapable of flight and notrarely lying under wing cases firmly soldered together the meaning of rudimentary organs is often quite unmistakeable forinstance there are beetles of the same genus and even of the samespecies resembling each other most closely in all respects oneof which will have full sized wings and another mere rudiments ofmembrane and here it is impossible to doubt that the rudimentsrepresent wings rudimentary organs sometimes retain their potentiality and are merely not developed this seems to be the case with the mammaeof male mammals for many instances are on record of these organs havingbecome well developed in full grown males and having secreted milk soagain there are normally four developed and two rudimentary teats inthe udders of the genus bos but in our domestic cows the two sometimesbecome developed and give milk in individual plants of the samespecies the petals sometimes occur as mere rudiments and sometimes ina well developed state in plants with separated sexes the male flowersoften have a rudiment of a pistil and kolreuter found that by crossingsuch male plants with an hermaphrodite species the rudiment of thepistil in the hybrid offspring was much increased in size and thisshows that the rudiment and the perfect pistil are essentially alike innature an organ serving for two purposes may become rudimentary or utterlyaborted for one even the more important purpose and remain perfectlyefficient for the other thus in plants the office of the pistil is toallow the pollen tubes to reach the ovules protected in the ovarium atits base the pistil consists of a stigma supported on the style but insome compositae the male florets which of course cannot be fecundated have a pistil which is in a rudimentary state for it is not crownedwith a stigma but the style remains well developed and is clothed withhairs as in other compositae for the purpose of brushing the pollen outof the surrounding anthers again an organ may become rudimentary forits proper purpose and be used for a distinct object in certain fishthe swim bladder seems to be rudimentary for its proper function ofgiving buoyancy but has become converted into a nascent breathing organor lung other similar instances could be given rudimentary organs in the individuals of the same species are veryliable to vary in degree of development and in other respects moreover in closely allied species the degree to which the same organ has beenrendered rudimentary occasionally differs much this latter fact is wellexemplified in the state of the wings of the female moths in certaingroups rudimentary organs may be utterly aborted and this implies that we find in an animal or plant no trace of an organ which analogywould lead us to expect to find and which is occasionally foundin monstrous individuals of the species thus in the snapdragon antirrhinum we generally do not find a rudiment of a fifth stamen butthis may sometimes be seen in tracing the homologies of the samepart in different members of a class nothing is more common or morenecessary than the use and discovery of rudiments this is well shownin the drawings given by owen of the bones of the leg of the horse ox and rhinoceros it is an important fact that rudimentary organs such as teeth in theupper jaws of whales and ruminants can often be detected in the embryo but afterwards wholly disappear it is also i believe a universalrule that a rudimentary part or organ is of greater size relatively tothe adjoining parts in the embryo than in the adult so that the organat this early age is less rudimentary or even cannot be said to be inany degree rudimentary hence also a rudimentary organ in the adult is often said to have retained its embryonic condition i have now given the leading facts with respect to rudimentary organs in reflecting on them every one must be struck with astonishment forthe same reasoning power which tells us plainly that most parts andorgans are exquisitely adapted for certain purposes tells us with equalplainness that these rudimentary or atrophied organs are imperfect anduseless in works on natural history rudimentary organs are generallysaid to have been created for the sake of symmetry or in order tocomplete the scheme of nature but this seems to me no explanation merely a restatement of the fact would it be thought sufficient tosay that because planets revolve in elliptic courses round the sun satellites follow the same course round the planets for the sake ofsymmetry and to complete the scheme of nature an eminent physiologistaccounts for the presence of rudimentary organs by supposing that theyserve to excrete matter in excess or injurious to the system but canwe suppose that the minute papilla which often represents the pistilin male flowers and which is formed merely of cellular tissue can thusact can we suppose that the formation of rudimentary teeth which aresubsequently absorbed can be of any service to the rapidly growingembryonic calf by the excretion of precious phosphate of lime when aman s fingers have been amputated imperfect nails sometimes appear onthe stumps i could as soon believe that these vestiges of nails haveappeared not from unknown laws of growth but in order to excrete hornymatter as that the rudimentary nails on the fin of the manatee wereformed for this purpose on my view of descent with modification the origin of rudimentaryorgans is simple we have plenty of cases of rudimentary organs in ourdomestic productions as the stump of a tail in tailless breeds thevestige of an ear in earless breeds the reappearance of minutedangling horns in hornless breeds of cattle more especially accordingto youatt in young animals and the state of the whole flower in thecauliflower we often see rudiments of various parts in monsters buti doubt whether any of these cases throw light on the origin ofrudimentary organs in a state of nature further than by showing thatrudiments can be produced for i doubt whether species under nature everundergo abrupt changes i believe that disuse has been the main agency that it has led in successive generations to the gradual reduction ofvarious organs until they have become rudimentary as in the case ofthe eyes of animals inhabiting dark caverns and of the wings of birdsinhabiting oceanic islands which have seldom been forced to takeflight and have ultimately lost the power of flying again an organuseful under certain conditions might become injurious under others as with the wings of beetles living on small and exposed islands and inthis case natural selection would continue slowly to reduce the organ until it was rendered harmless and rudimentary any change in function which can be effected by insensibly small steps is within the power of natural selection so that an organ rendered during changed habits of life useless or injurious for one purpose might easily be modified and used for another purpose or an organmight be retained for one alone of its former functions an organ whenrendered useless may well be variable for its variations cannot bechecked by natural selection at whatever period of life disuse orselection reduces an organ and this will generally be when the beinghas come to maturity and to its full powers of action the principleof inheritance at corresponding ages will reproduce the organ in itsreduced state at the same age and consequently will seldom affect orreduce it in the embryo thus we can understand the greater relativesize of rudimentary organs in the embryo and their lesser relative sizein the adult but if each step of the process of reduction were tobe inherited not at the corresponding age but at an extremely earlyperiod of life as we have good reason to believe to be possible therudimentary part would tend to be wholly lost and we should have a caseof complete abortion the principle also of economy explained in aformer chapter by which the materials forming any part or structure ifnot useful to the possessor will be saved as far as is possible willprobably often come into play and this will tend to cause the entireobliteration of a rudimentary organ as the presence of rudimentary organs is thus due to the tendencyin every part of the organisation which has long existed tobe inherited we can understand on the genealogical view ofclassification how it is that systematists have found rudimentaryparts as useful as or even sometimes more useful than parts of highphysiological importance rudimentary organs may be compared with theletters in a word still retained in the spelling but become uselessin the pronunciation but which serve as a clue in seeking for itsderivation on the view of descent with modification we may concludethat the existence of organs in a rudimentary imperfect and uselesscondition or quite aborted far from presenting a strange difficulty as they assuredly do on the ordinary doctrine of creation mighteven have been anticipated and can be accounted for by the laws ofinheritance summary in this chapter i have attempted to show that the subordination ofgroup to group in all organisms throughout all time that the nature ofthe relationship by which all living and extinct beings are united bycomplex radiating and circuitous lines of affinities into onegrand system the rules followed and the difficulties encountered bynaturalists in their classifications the value set upon characters ifconstant and prevalent whether of high vital importance or of the mosttrifling importance or as in rudimentary organs of no importance thewide opposition in value between analogical or adaptive characters andcharacters of true affinity and other such rules all naturally followon the view of the common parentage of those forms which are consideredby naturalists as allied together with their modification throughnatural selection with its contingencies of extinction and divergenceof character in considering this view of classification it should beborne in mind that the element of descent has been universally used inranking together the sexes ages and acknowledged varieties of the samespecies however different they may be in structure if we extend theuse of this element of descent the only certainly known cause ofsimilarity in organic beings we shall understand what is meant by thenatural system it is genealogical in its attempted arrangement with the grades of acquired difference marked by the terms varieties species genera families orders and classes on this same view of descent with modification all the great facts inmorphology become intelligible whether we look to the same patterndisplayed in the homologous organs to whatever purpose applied of thedifferent species of a class or to the homologous parts constructed onthe same pattern in each individual animal and plant on the principle of successive slight variations not necessarilyor generally supervening at a very early period of life and beinginherited at a corresponding period we can understand the great leadingfacts in embryology namely the resemblance in an individual embryo ofthe homologous parts which when matured will become widely differentfrom each other in structure and function and the resemblance indifferent species of a class of the homologous parts or organs thoughfitted in the adult members for purposes as different as possible larvae are active embryos which have become specially modified inrelation to their habits of life through the principle of modificationsbeing inherited at corresponding ages on this same principle andbearing in mind that when organs are reduced in size either fromdisuse or selection it will generally be at that period of life whenthe being has to provide for its own wants and bearing in mind howstrong is the principle of inheritance the occurrence of rudimentaryorgans and their final abortion present to us no inexplicabledifficulties on the contrary their presence might have been evenanticipated the importance of embryological characters and ofrudimentary organs in classification is intelligible on the view thatan arrangement is only so far natural as it is genealogical finally the several classes of facts which have been considered inthis chapter seem to me to proclaim so plainly that the innumerablespecies genera and families of organic beings with which this worldis peopled have all descended each within its own class or group fromcommon parents and have all been modified in the course of descent that i should without hesitation adopt this view even if it wereunsupported by other facts or arguments recapitulation and conclusion recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of natural selection recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour causes of the general belief in the immutability of species how far thetheory of natural selection may be extended effects of its adoption onthe study of natural history concluding remarks as this whole volume is one long argument it may be convenient to thereader to have the leading facts and inferences briefly recapitulated that many and grave objections may be advanced against the theory ofdescent with modification through natural selection i do not deny ihave endeavoured to give to them their full force nothing at first canappear more difficult to believe than that the more complex organs andinstincts should have been perfected not by means superior to thoughanalogous with human reason but by the accumulation of innumerableslight variations each good for the individual possessor nevertheless this difficulty though appearing to our imagination insuperably great cannot be considered real if we admit the following propositions namely that gradations in the perfection of any organ or instinct which we may consider either do now exist or could have existed eachgood of its kind that all organs and instincts are in ever so slighta degree variable and lastly that there is a struggle for existenceleading to the preservation of each profitable deviation of structure orinstinct the truth of these propositions cannot i think be disputed it is no doubt extremely difficult even to conjecture by whatgradations many structures have been perfected more especially amongstbroken and failing groups of organic beings but we see so many strangegradations in nature as is proclaimed by the canon natura non facitsaltum that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organor instinct or any whole being could not have arrived at its presentstate by many graduated steps there are it must be admitted cases ofspecial difficulty on the theory of natural selection and one of themost curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castesof workers or sterile females in the same community of ants but i haveattempted to show how this difficulty can be mastered with respect to the almost universal sterility of species when firstcrossed which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universalfertility of varieties when crossed i must refer the reader to therecapitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chapter which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no morea special endowment than is the incapacity of two trees to be graftedtogether but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in thereproductive systems of the intercrossed species we see the truth ofthis conclusion in the vast difference in the result when the same twospecies are crossed reciprocally that is when one species is firstused as the father and then as the mother the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongreloffspring cannot be considered as universal nor is their very generalfertility surprising when we remember that it is not likely that eithertheir constitutions or their reproductive systems should have beenprofoundly modified moreover most of the varieties which have beenexperimentised on have been produced under domestication and asdomestication apparently tends to eliminate sterility we ought not toexpect it also to produce sterility the sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of firstcrosses for their reproductive organs are more or less functionallyimpotent whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in aperfect condition as we continually see that organisms of all kindsare rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having beendisturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life we neednot feel surprise at hybrids being in some degree sterile for theirconstitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from beingcompounded of two distinct organisations this parallelism is supportedby another parallel but directly opposite class of facts namely thatthe vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slightchanges in their conditions of life and that the offspring of slightlymodified forms or varieties acquire from being crossed increased vigourand fertility so that on the one hand considerable changes in theconditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms lessenfertility and on the other hand lesser changes in the conditions oflife and crosses between less modified forms increase fertility turning to geographical distribution the difficulties encounteredon the theory of descent with modification are grave enough all theindividuals of the same species and all the species of the same genus or even higher group must have descended from common parents andtherefore in however distant and isolated parts of the world they arenow found they must in the course of successive generations have passedfrom some one part to the others we are often wholly unable even toconjecture how this could have been effected yet as we have reason tobelieve that some species have retained the same specific form for verylong periods enormously long as measured by years too much stressought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the samespecies for during very long periods of time there will always be agood chance for wide migration by many means a broken or interruptedrange may often be accounted for by the extinction of the species inthe intermediate regions it cannot be denied that we are as yet veryignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geographicalchanges which have affected the earth during modern periods andsuch changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration as anexample i have attempted to show how potent has been the influenceof the glacial period on the distribution both of the same and ofrepresentative species throughout the world we are as yet profoundlyignorant of the many occasional means of transport with respect todistinct species of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolatedregions as the process of modification has necessarily been slow all the means of migration will have been possible during a very longperiod and consequently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of speciesof the same genus is in some degree lessened as on the theory of natural selection an interminable number ofintermediate forms must have existed linking together all the speciesin each group by gradations as fine as our present varieties it may beasked why do we not see these linking forms all around us why arenot all organic beings blended together in an inextricable chaos withrespect to existing forms we should remember that we have no right toexpect excepting in rare cases to discover directly connecting linksbetween them but only between each and some extinct and supplantedform even on a wide area which has during a long period remainedcontinuous and of which the climate and other conditions of life changeinsensibly in going from a district occupied by one species into anotherdistrict occupied by a closely allied species we have no just right toexpect often to find intermediate varieties in the intermediate zone for we have reason to believe that only a few species are undergoingchange at any one period and all changes are slowly effected i havealso shown that the intermediate varieties which will at first probablyexist in the intermediate zones will be liable to be supplanted by theallied forms on either hand and the latter from existing in greaternumbers will generally be modified and improved at a quicker rate thanthe intermediate varieties which exist in lesser numbers so thatthe intermediate varieties will in the long run be supplanted andexterminated on this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of connectinglinks between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world and ateach successive period between the extinct and still older species whyis not every geological formation charged with such links why doesnot every collection of fossil remains afford plain evidence of thegradation and mutation of the forms of life we meet with no suchevidence and this is the most obvious and forcible of the manyobjections which may be urged against my theory why again do wholegroups of allied species appear though certainly they often falselyappear to have come in suddenly on the several geological stages whydo we not find great piles of strata beneath the silurian system storedwith the remains of the progenitors of the silurian groups of fossils for certainly on my theory such strata must somewhere have beendeposited at these ancient and utterly unknown epochs in the world shistory i can answer these questions and grave objections only on thesupposition that the geological record is far more imperfect than mostgeologists believe it cannot be objected that there has not been timesufficient for any amount of organic change for the lapse of time hasbeen so great as to be utterly inappreciable by the human intellect thenumber of specimens in all our museums is absolutely as nothing comparedwith the countless generations of countless species which certainly haveexisted we should not be able to recognise a species as the parentof any one or more species if we were to examine them ever so closely unless we likewise possessed many of the intermediate links betweentheir past or parent and present states and these many links wecould hardly ever expect to discover owing to the imperfection of thegeological record numerous existing doubtful forms could be named whichare probably varieties but who will pretend that in future ages somany fossil links will be discovered that naturalists will be ableto decide on the common view whether or not these doubtful forms arevarieties as long as most of the links between any two species areunknown if any one link or intermediate variety be discovered it willsimply be classed as another and distinct species only a small portionof the world has been geologically explored only organic beings ofcertain classes can be preserved in a fossil condition at least in anygreat number widely ranging species vary most and varieties are oftenat first local both causes rendering the discovery of intermediatelinks less likely local varieties will not spread into other anddistant regions until they are considerably modified and improved andwhen they do spread if discovered in a geological formation they willappear as if suddenly created there and will be simply classed as newspecies most formations have been intermittent in their accumulation and their duration i am inclined to believe has been shorter than theaverage duration of specific forms successive formations are separatedfrom each other by enormous blank intervals of time for fossiliferousformations thick enough to resist future degradation can beaccumulated only where much sediment is deposited on the subsiding bedof the sea during the alternate periods of elevation and of stationarylevel the record will be blank during these latter periods there willprobably be more variability in the forms of life during periods ofsubsidence more extinction with respect to the absence of fossiliferous formations beneath thelowest silurian strata i can only recur to the hypothesis given in theninth chapter that the geological record is imperfect all will admit but that it is imperfect to the degree which i require few will beinclined to admit if we look to long enough intervals of time geologyplainly declares that all species have changed and they have changed inthe manner which my theory requires for they have changed slowly andin a graduated manner we clearly see this in the fossil remains fromconsecutive formations invariably being much more closely related toeach other than are the fossils from formations distant from each otherin time such is the sum of the several chief objections and difficultieswhich may justly be urged against my theory and i have now brieflyrecapitulated the answers and explanations which can be given to them ihave felt these difficulties far too heavily during many years to doubttheir weight but it deserves especial notice that the more importantobjections relate to questions on which we are confessedly ignorant nor do we know how ignorant we are we do not know all the possibletransitional gradations between the simplest and the most perfectorgans it cannot be pretended that we know all the varied meansof distribution during the long lapse of years or that we know howimperfect the geological record is grave as these several difficultiesare in my judgment they do not overthrow the theory of descent withmodification now let us turn to the other side of the argument under domesticationwe see much variability this seems to be mainly due to the reproductivesystem being eminently susceptible to changes in the conditions of life so that this system when not rendered impotent fails to reproduceoffspring exactly like the parent form variability is governed by manycomplex laws by correlation of growth by use and disuse and bythe direct action of the physical conditions of life there ismuch difficulty in ascertaining how much modification our domesticproductions have undergone but we may safely infer that the amount hasbeen large and that modifications can be inherited for long periods as long as the conditions of life remain the same we have reason tobelieve that a modification which has already been inherited for manygenerations may continue to be inherited for an almost infinite numberof generations on the other hand we have evidence that variability when it has once come into play does not wholly cease for newvarieties are still occasionally produced by our most ancientlydomesticated productions man does not actually produce variability he only unintentionallyexposes organic beings to new conditions of life and then nature actson the organisation and causes variability but man can and does selectthe variations given to him by nature and thus accumulate them in anydesired manner he thus adapts animals and plants for his own benefit orpleasure he may do this methodically or he may do it unconsciously bypreserving the individuals most useful to him at the time withoutany thought of altering the breed it is certain that he can largelyinfluence the character of a breed by selecting in each successivegeneration individual differences so slight as to be quiteinappreciable by an uneducated eye this process of selection has beenthe great agency in the production of the most distinct and usefuldomestic breeds that many of the breeds produced by man have to a largeextent the character of natural species is shown by the inextricabledoubts whether very many of them are varieties or aboriginal species there is no obvious reason why the principles which have acted soefficiently under domestication should not have acted under nature in the preservation of favoured individuals and races during theconstantly recurrent struggle for existence we see the most powerfuland ever acting means of selection the struggle for existenceinevitably follows from the high geometrical ratio of increase which iscommon to all organic beings this high rate of increase is proved bycalculation by the effects of a succession of peculiar seasons and bythe results of naturalisation as explained in the third chapter moreindividuals are born than can possibly survive a grain in the balancewill determine which individual shall live and which shall die whichvariety or species shall increase in number and which shall decrease or finally become extinct as the individuals of the same speciescome in all respects into the closest competition with each other thestruggle will generally be most severe between them it will be almostequally severe between the varieties of the same species and next inseverity between the species of the same genus but the struggle willoften be very severe between beings most remote in the scale of nature the slightest advantage in one being at any age or during any season over those with which it comes into competition or better adaptationin however slight a degree to the surrounding physical conditions willturn the balance with animals having separated sexes there will in most cases be astruggle between the males for possession of the females the mostvigorous individuals or those which have most successfully struggledwith their conditions of life will generally leave most progeny butsuccess will often depend on having special weapons or means of defence or on the charms of the males and the slightest advantage will lead tovictory as geology plainly proclaims that each land has undergone great physicalchanges we might have expected that organic beings would have variedunder nature in the same way as they generally have varied under thechanged conditions of domestication and if there be any variabilityunder nature it would be an unaccountable fact if natural selectionhad not come into play it has often been asserted but the assertion isquite incapable of proof that the amount of variation under nature isa strictly limited quantity man though acting on external charactersalone and often capriciously can produce within a short period agreat result by adding up mere individual differences in his domesticproductions and every one admits that there are at least individualdifferences in species under nature but besides such differences allnaturalists have admitted the existence of varieties which they thinksufficiently distinct to be worthy of record in systematic works no onecan draw any clear distinction between individual differences and slightvarieties or between more plainly marked varieties and sub species and species let it be observed how naturalists differ in the rankwhich they assign to the many representative forms in europe and northamerica if then we have under nature variability and a powerful agent alwaysready to act and select why should we doubt that variations in any wayuseful to beings under their excessively complex relations of life would be preserved accumulated and inherited why if man can bypatience select variations most useful to himself should nature fail inselecting variations useful under changing conditions of life to herliving products what limit can be put to this power acting during longages and rigidly scrutinising the whole constitution structure andhabits of each creature favouring the good and rejecting the bad ican see no limit to this power in slowly and beautifully adaptingeach form to the most complex relations of life the theory of naturalselection even if we looked no further than this seems to me to be initself probable i have already recapitulated as fairly as i could the opposed difficulties and objections now let us turn to the specialfacts and arguments in favour of the theory on the view that species are only strongly marked and permanentvarieties and that each species first existed as a variety we cansee why it is that no line of demarcation can be drawn between species commonly supposed to have been produced by special acts of creation and varieties which are acknowledged to have been produced by secondarylaws on this same view we can understand how it is that in each regionwhere many species of a genus have been produced and where they nowflourish these same species should present many varieties for wherethe manufactory of species has been active we might expect as ageneral rule to find it still in action and this is the case ifvarieties be incipient species moreover the species of the largergenera which afford the greater number of varieties or incipientspecies retain to a certain degree the character of varieties forthey differ from each other by a less amount of difference than do thespecies of smaller genera the closely allied species also of the largergenera apparently have restricted ranges and they are clustered inlittle groups round other species in which respects they resemblevarieties these are strange relations on the view of each specieshaving been independently created but are intelligible if all speciesfirst existed as varieties as each species tends by its geometrical ratio of reproduction toincrease inordinately in number and as the modified descendants of eachspecies will be enabled to increase by so much the more as they becomemore diversified in habits and structure so as to be enabled to seizeon many and widely different places in the economy of nature therewill be a constant tendency in natural selection to preserve the mostdivergent offspring of any one species hence during a long continuedcourse of modification the slight differences characteristic ofvarieties of the same species tend to be augmented into the greaterdifferences characteristic of species of the same genus new andimproved varieties will inevitably supplant and exterminate the older less improved and intermediate varieties and thus species are renderedto a large extent defined and distinct objects dominant speciesbelonging to the larger groups tend to give birth to new and dominantforms so that each large group tends to become still larger and atthe same time more divergent in character but as all groups cannot thussucceed in increasing in size for the world would not hold them themore dominant groups beat the less dominant this tendency in the largegroups to go on increasing in size and diverging in character togetherwith the almost inevitable contingency of much extinction explains thearrangement of all the forms of life in groups subordinate to groups all within a few great classes which we now see everywhere around us and which has prevailed throughout all time this grand fact of thegrouping of all organic beings seems to me utterly inexplicable on thetheory of creation as natural selection acts solely by accumulating slight successive favourable variations it can produce no great or sudden modification it can act only by very short and slow steps hence the canon of naturanon facit saltum which every fresh addition to our knowledge tends tomake more strictly correct is on this theory simply intelligible wecan plainly see why nature is prodigal in variety though niggard ininnovation but why this should be a law of nature if each species hasbeen independently created no man can explain many other facts are as it seems to me explicable on this theory howstrange it is that a bird under the form of woodpecker should havebeen created to prey on insects on the ground that upland geese whichnever or rarely swim should have been created with webbed feet that athrush should have been created to dive and feed on sub aquatic insects and that a petrel should have been created with habits and structurefitting it for the life of an auk or grebe and so on in endless othercases but on the view of each species constantly trying to increase innumber with natural selection always ready to adapt the slowly varyingdescendants of each to any unoccupied or ill occupied place in nature these facts cease to be strange or perhaps might even have beenanticipated as natural selection acts by competition it adapts the inhabitantsof each country only in relation to the degree of perfection of theirassociates so that we need feel no surprise at the inhabitants ofany one country although on the ordinary view supposed to have beenspecially created and adapted for that country being beaten andsupplanted by the naturalised productions from another land nor oughtwe to marvel if all the contrivances in nature be not as far as we canjudge absolutely perfect and if some of them be abhorrent to our ideasof fitness we need not marvel at the sting of the bee causing the bee sown death at drones being produced in such vast numbers for onesingle act and being then slaughtered by their sterile sisters at theastonishing waste of pollen by our fir trees at the instinctive hatredof the queen bee for her own fertile daughters at ichneumonidae feedingwithin the live bodies of caterpillars and at other such cases thewonder indeed is on the theory of natural selection that more cases ofthe want of absolute perfection have not been observed the complex and little known laws governing variation are the same asfar as we can see with the laws which have governed the production ofso called specific forms in both cases physical conditions seem to haveproduced but little direct effect yet when varieties enter any zone they occasionally assume some of the characters of the species properto that zone in both varieties and species use and disuse seem to haveproduced some effect for it is difficult to resist this conclusionwhen we look for instance at the logger headed duck which has wingsincapable of flight in nearly the same condition as in the domesticduck or when we look at the burrowing tucutucu which is occasionallyblind and then at certain moles which are habitually blind and havetheir eyes covered with skin or when we look at the blind animalsinhabiting the dark caves of america and europe in both varieties andspecies correlation of growth seems to have played a most importantpart so that when one part has been modified other parts arenecessarily modified in both varieties and species reversions tolong lost characters occur how inexplicable on the theory of creationis the occasional appearance of stripes on the shoulder and legs of theseveral species of the horse genus and in their hybrids how simply isthis fact explained if we believe that these species have descended froma striped progenitor in the same manner as the several domestic breedsof pigeon have descended from the blue and barred rock pigeon on the ordinary view of each species having been independently created why should the specific characters or those by which the species ofthe same genus differ from each other be more variable than the genericcharacters in which they all agree why for instance should the colourof a flower be more likely to vary in any one species of a genus ifthe other species supposed to have been created independently havedifferently coloured flowers than if all the species of the genus havethe same coloured flowers if species are only well marked varieties of which the characters have become in a high degree permanent we canunderstand this fact for they have already varied since they branchedoff from a common progenitor in certain characters by which they havecome to be specifically distinct from each other and therefore thesesame characters would be more likely still to be variable than thegeneric characters which have been inherited without change for anenormous period it is inexplicable on the theory of creation why a partdeveloped in a very unusual manner in any one species of a genus and therefore as we may naturally infer of great importance to thespecies should be eminently liable to variation but on my view thispart has undergone since the several species branched off from a commonprogenitor an unusual amount of variability and modification andtherefore we might expect this part generally to be still variable buta part may be developed in the most unusual manner like the wing of abat and yet not be more variable than any other structure if the partbe common to many subordinate forms that is if it has been inheritedfor a very long period for in this case it will have been renderedconstant by long continued natural selection glancing at instincts marvellous as some are they offer no greaterdifficulty than does corporeal structure on the theory of the naturalselection of successive slight but profitable modifications wecan thus understand why nature moves by graduated steps in endowingdifferent animals of the same class with their several instincts i haveattempted to show how much light the principle of gradation throwson the admirable architectural powers of the hive bee habit no doubtsometimes comes into play in modifying instincts but it certainly isnot indispensable as we see in the case of neuter insects which leaveno progeny to inherit the effects of long continued habit on the viewof all the species of the same genus having descended from a commonparent and having inherited much in common we can understand how it isthat allied species when placed under considerably different conditionsof life yet should follow nearly the same instincts why the thrush ofsouth america for instance lines her nest with mud like our britishspecies on the view of instincts having been slowly acquired throughnatural selection we need not marvel at some instincts being apparentlynot perfect and liable to mistakes and at many instincts causing otheranimals to suffer if species be only well marked and permanent varieties we can at oncesee why their crossed offspring should follow the same complex lawsin their degrees and kinds of resemblance to their parents in beingabsorbed into each other by successive crosses and in other suchpoints as do the crossed offspring of acknowledged varieties onthe other hand these would be strange facts if species have beenindependently created and varieties have been produced by secondarylaws if we admit that the geological record is imperfect in an extremedegree then such facts as the record gives support the theory ofdescent with modification new species have come on the stage slowly andat successive intervals and the amount of change after equal intervalsof time is widely different in different groups the extinction ofspecies and of whole groups of species which has played so conspicuousa part in the history of the organic world almost inevitably follows onthe principle of natural selection for old forms will be supplantedby new and improved forms neither single species nor groups of speciesreappear when the chain of ordinary generation has once been broken thegradual diffusion of dominant forms with the slow modification of theirdescendants causes the forms of life after long intervals of time toappear as if they had changed simultaneously throughout the world the fact of the fossil remains of each formation being in some degreeintermediate in character between the fossils in the formations aboveand below is simply explained by their intermediate position in thechain of descent the grand fact that all extinct organic beings belongto the same system with recent beings falling either into the same orinto intermediate groups follows from the living and the extinct beingthe offspring of common parents as the groups which have descendedfrom an ancient progenitor have generally diverged in character theprogenitor with its early descendants will often be intermediate incharacter in comparison with its later descendants and thus we can seewhy the more ancient a fossil is the oftener it stands in some degreeintermediate between existing and allied groups recent forms aregenerally looked at as being in some vague sense higher than ancientand extinct forms and they are in so far higher as the later and moreimproved forms have conquered the older and less improved organic beingsin the struggle for life lastly the law of the long endurance ofallied forms on the same continent of marsupials in australia ofedentata in america and other such cases is intelligible for withina confined country the recent and the extinct will naturally be alliedby descent looking to geographical distribution if we admit that there has beenduring the long course of ages much migration from one part of the worldto another owing to former climatal and geographical changes and to themany occasional and unknown means of dispersal then we can understand on the theory of descent with modification most of the great leadingfacts in distribution we can see why there should be so striking aparallelism in the distribution of organic beings throughout space andin their geological succession throughout time for in both cases thebeings have been connected by the bond of ordinary generation and themeans of modification have been the same we see the full meaning of thewonderful fact which must have struck every traveller namely that onthe same continent under the most diverse conditions under heat andcold on mountain and lowland on deserts and marshes most of theinhabitants within each great class are plainly related for they willgenerally be descendants of the same progenitors and early colonists on this same principle of former migration combined in most cases withmodification we can understand by the aid of the glacial period theidentity of some few plants and the close alliance of many others on the most distant mountains under the most different climates andlikewise the close alliance of some of the inhabitants of the sea inthe northern and southern temperate zones though separated by the wholeintertropical ocean although two areas may present the same physicalconditions of life we need feel no surprise at their inhabitantsbeing widely different if they have been for a long period completelyseparated from each other for as the relation of organism to organismis the most important of all relations and as the two areas will havereceived colonists from some third source or from each other at variousperiods and in different proportions the course of modification in thetwo areas will inevitably be different on this view of migration with subsequent modification we can see whyoceanic islands should be inhabited by few species but of these thatmany should be peculiar we can clearly see why those animals whichcannot cross wide spaces of ocean as frogs and terrestrial mammals should not inhabit oceanic islands and why on the other hand new andpeculiar species of bats which can traverse the ocean should so oftenbe found on islands far distant from any continent such facts as thepresence of peculiar species of bats and the absence of all othermammals on oceanic islands are utterly inexplicable on the theory ofindependent acts of creation the existence of closely allied or representative species in any twoareas implies on the theory of descent with modification that thesame parents formerly inhabited both areas and we almost invariablyfind that wherever many closely allied species inhabit two areas someidentical species common to both still exist wherever many closelyallied yet distinct species occur many doubtful forms and varieties ofthe same species likewise occur it is a rule of high generality thatthe inhabitants of each area are related to the inhabitants of thenearest source whence immigrants might have been derived we see this innearly all the plants and animals of the galapagos archipelago of juanfernandez and of the other american islands being related in the moststriking manner to the plants and animals of the neighbouring americanmainland and those of the cape de verde archipelago and other africanislands to the african mainland it must be admitted that these factsreceive no explanation on the theory of creation the fact as we have seen that all past and present organic beingsconstitute one grand natural system with group subordinate to group and with extinct groups often falling in between recent groups isintelligible on the theory of natural selection with its contingenciesof extinction and divergence of character on these same principleswe see how it is that the mutual affinities of the species and generawithin each class are so complex and circuitous we see why certaincharacters are far more serviceable than others for classification whyadaptive characters though of paramount importance to the being areof hardly any importance in classification why characters derived fromrudimentary parts though of no service to the being are often of highclassificatory value and why embryological characters are the mostvaluable of all the real affinities of all organic beings are dueto inheritance or community of descent the natural system is agenealogical arrangement in which we have to discover the lines ofdescent by the most permanent characters however slight their vitalimportance may be the framework of bones being the same in the hand of a man wing ofa bat fin of the porpoise and leg of the horse the same number ofvertebrae forming the neck of the giraffe and of the elephant andinnumerable other such facts at once explain themselves on the theoryof descent with slow and slight successive modifications the similarityof pattern in the wing and leg of a bat though used for such differentpurpose in the jaws and legs of a crab in the petals stamens andpistils of a flower is likewise intelligible on the view of thegradual modification of parts or organs which were alike in the earlyprogenitor of each class on the principle of successive variationsnot always supervening at an early age and being inherited at acorresponding not early period of life we can clearly see why theembryos of mammals birds reptiles and fishes should be so closelyalike and should be so unlike the adult forms we may cease marvellingat the embryo of an air breathing mammal or bird having branchial slitsand arteries running in loops like those in a fish which has to breathethe air dissolved in water by the aid of well developed branchiae disuse aided sometimes by natural selection will often tend to reducean organ when it has become useless by changed habits or under changedconditions of life and we can clearly understand on this view themeaning of rudimentary organs but disuse and selection will generallyact on each creature when it has come to maturity and has to play itsfull part in the struggle for existence and will thus have little powerof acting on an organ during early life hence the organ will not bemuch reduced or rendered rudimentary at this early age the calf forinstance has inherited teeth which never cut through the gums of theupper jaw from an early progenitor having well developed teeth and wemay believe that the teeth in the mature animal were reduced duringsuccessive generations by disuse or by the tongue and palate havingbeen fitted by natural selection to browse without their aid whereas inthe calf the teeth have been left untouched by selection or disuse and on the principle of inheritance at corresponding ages have beeninherited from a remote period to the present day on the view of eachorganic being and each separate organ having been specially created howutterly inexplicable it is that parts like the teeth in the embryoniccalf or like the shrivelled wings under the soldered wing covers of somebeetles should thus so frequently bear the plain stamp of inutility nature may be said to have taken pains to reveal by rudimentary organsand by homologous structures her scheme of modification which it seemsthat we wilfully will not understand i have now recapitulated the chief facts and considerations which havethoroughly convinced me that species have changed and are still slowlychanging by the preservation and accumulation of successive slightfavourable variations why it may be asked have all the most eminentliving naturalists and geologists rejected this view of the mutabilityof species it cannot be asserted that organic beings in a state ofnature are subject to no variation it cannot be proved that the amountof variation in the course of long ages is a limited quantity no cleardistinction has been or can be drawn between species and well markedvarieties it cannot be maintained that species when intercrossed areinvariably sterile and varieties invariably fertile or that sterilityis a special endowment and sign of creation the belief that specieswere immutable productions was almost unavoidable as long as the historyof the world was thought to be of short duration and now that we haveacquired some idea of the lapse of time we are too apt to assume without proof that the geological record is so perfect that it wouldhave afforded us plain evidence of the mutation of species if they hadundergone mutation but the chief cause of our natural unwillingness to admit that onespecies has given birth to other and distinct species is that we arealways slow in admitting any great change of which we do not see theintermediate steps the difficulty is the same as that felt by so manygeologists when lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffshad been formed and great valleys excavated by the slow action of thecoast waves the mind cannot possibly grasp the full meaning of theterm of a hundred million years it cannot add up and perceive the fulleffects of many slight variations accumulated during an almost infinitenumber of generations although i am fully convinced of the truth of the views given in thisvolume under the form of an abstract i by no means expect to convinceexperienced naturalists whose minds are stocked with a multitude offacts all viewed during a long course of years from a point of viewdirectly opposite to mine it is so easy to hide our ignorance undersuch expressions as the plan of creation unity of design etc andto think that we give an explanation when we only restate a fact anyone whose disposition leads him to attach more weight to unexplaineddifficulties than to the explanation of a certain number of factswill certainly reject my theory a few naturalists endowed withmuch flexibility of mind and who have already begun to doubt on theimmutability of species may be influenced by this volume but i lookwith confidence to the future to young and rising naturalists who willbe able to view both sides of the question with impartiality whoeveris led to believe that species are mutable will do good service byconscientiously expressing his conviction for only thus can the load ofprejudice by which this subject is overwhelmed be removed several eminent naturalists have of late published their belief thata multitude of reputed species in each genus are not real species butthat other species are real that is have been independently created this seems to me a strange conclusion to arrive at they admit thata multitude of forms which till lately they themselves thought werespecial creations and which are still thus looked at by the majority ofnaturalists and which consequently have every external characteristicfeature of true species they admit that these have been produced byvariation but they refuse to extend the same view to other and veryslightly different forms nevertheless they do not pretend that theycan define or even conjecture which are the created forms of life andwhich are those produced by secondary laws they admit variation as avera causa in one case they arbitrarily reject it in another withoutassigning any distinction in the two cases the day will come when thiswill be given as a curious illustration of the blindness of preconceivedopinion these authors seem no more startled at a miraculous act ofcreation than at an ordinary birth but do they really believe that atinnumerable periods in the earth s history certain elemental atoms havebeen commanded suddenly to flash into living tissues do they believethat at each supposed act of creation one individual or many wereproduced were all the infinitely numerous kinds of animals and plantscreated as eggs or seed or as full grown and in the case of mammals were they created bearing the false marks of nourishment from themother s womb although naturalists very properly demand a fullexplanation of every difficulty from those who believe in the mutabilityof species on their own side they ignore the whole subject of the firstappearance of species in what they consider reverent silence it may be asked how far i extend the doctrine of the modification ofspecies the question is difficult to answer because the more distinctthe forms are which we may consider by so much the arguments fall awayin force but some arguments of the greatest weight extend very far all the members of whole classes can be connected together by chains ofaffinities and all can be classified on the same principle in groupssubordinate to groups fossil remains sometimes tend to fill upvery wide intervals between existing orders organs in a rudimentarycondition plainly show that an early progenitor had the organ in afully developed state and this in some instances necessarily impliesan enormous amount of modification in the descendants throughout wholeclasses various structures are formed on the same pattern and at anembryonic age the species closely resemble each other therefore icannot doubt that the theory of descent with modification embraces allthe members of the same class i believe that animals have descendedfrom at most only four or five progenitors and plants from an equal orlesser number analogy would lead me one step further namely to the belief that allanimals and plants have descended from some one prototype but analogymay be a deceitful guide nevertheless all living things have much incommon in their chemical composition their germinal vesicles theircellular structure and their laws of growth and reproduction we seethis even in so trifling a circumstance as that the same poison oftensimilarly affects plants and animals or that the poison secreted bythe gall fly produces monstrous growths on the wild rose or oak tree therefore i should infer from analogy that probably all the organicbeings which have ever lived on this earth have descended from someone primordial form into which life was first breathed when the viewsentertained in this volume on the origin of species or when analogousviews are generally admitted we can dimly foresee that there will be aconsiderable revolution in natural history systematists will be ableto pursue their labours as at present but they will not be incessantlyhaunted by the shadowy doubt whether this or that form be in essencea species this i feel sure and i speak after experience will be noslight relief the endless disputes whether or not some fifty speciesof british brambles are true species will cease systematists willhave only to decide not that this will be easy whether any form besufficiently constant and distinct from other forms to be capable ofdefinition and if definable whether the differences be sufficientlyimportant to deserve a specific name this latter point will become afar more essential consideration than it is at present for differences however slight between any two forms if not blended by intermediategradations are looked at by most naturalists as sufficient to raiseboth forms to the rank of species hereafter we shall be compelled toacknowledge that the only distinction between species and well markedvarieties is that the latter are known or believed to be connectedat the present day by intermediate gradations whereas specieswere formerly thus connected hence without quite rejecting theconsideration of the present existence of intermediate gradationsbetween any two forms we shall be led to weigh more carefully and tovalue higher the actual amount of difference between them it is quitepossible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varietiesmay hereafter be thought worthy of specific names as with the primroseand cowslip and in this case scientific and common language will comeinto accordance in short we shall have to treat species in the samemanner as those naturalists treat genera who admit that genera aremerely artificial combinations made for convenience this may not be acheering prospect but we shall at least be freed from the vain searchfor the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species the other and more general departments of natural history will risegreatly in interest the terms used by naturalists of affinity relationship community of type paternity morphology adaptivecharacters rudimentary and aborted organs etc will cease to bemetaphorical and will have a plain signification when we no longerlook at an organic being as a savage looks at a ship as at somethingwholly beyond his comprehension when we regard every production ofnature as one which has had a history when we contemplate every complexstructure and instinct as the summing up of many contrivances eachuseful to the possessor nearly in the same way as when we look atany great mechanical invention as the summing up of the labour theexperience the reason and even the blunders of numerous workmen whenwe thus view each organic being how far more interesting i speak fromexperience will the study of natural history become a grand and almost untrodden field of inquiry will be opened on thecauses and laws of variation on correlation of growth on the effectsof use and disuse on the direct action of external conditions and soforth the study of domestic productions will rise immensely in value a new variety raised by man will be a far more important and interestingsubject for study than one more species added to the infinitude ofalready recorded species our classifications will come to be as far asthey can be so made genealogies and will then truly give what may becalled the plan of creation the rules for classifying will no doubtbecome simpler when we have a definite object in view we possess nopedigrees or armorial bearings and we have to discover and tracethe many diverging lines of descent in our natural genealogies bycharacters of any kind which have long been inherited rudimentaryorgans will speak infallibly with respect to the nature of long loststructures species and groups of species which are called aberrant and which may fancifully be called living fossils will aid us informing a picture of the ancient forms of life embryology will revealto us the structure in some degree obscured of the prototypes of eachgreat class when we can feel assured that all the individuals of the same species and all the closely allied species of most genera have within a notvery remote period descended from one parent and have migratedfrom some one birthplace and when we better know the many meansof migration then by the light which geology now throws and willcontinue to throw on former changes of climate and of the level of theland we shall surely be enabled to trace in an admirable mannerthe former migrations of the inhabitants of the whole world even atpresent by comparing the differences of the inhabitants of the seaon the opposite sides of a continent and the nature of the variousinhabitants of that continent in relation to their apparent means ofimmigration some light can be thrown on ancient geography the noble science of geology loses glory from the extreme imperfectionof the record the crust of the earth with its embedded remains must notbe looked at as a well filled museum but as a poor collection madeat hazard and at rare intervals the accumulation of each greatfossiliferous formation will be recognised as having depended on anunusual concurrence of circumstances and the blank intervals betweenthe successive stages as having been of vast duration but we shall beable to gauge with some security the duration of these intervals by acomparison of the preceding and succeeding organic forms we must becautious in attempting to correlate as strictly contemporaneoustwo formations which include few identical species by the generalsuccession of their forms of life as species are produced andexterminated by slowly acting and still existing causes and notby miraculous acts of creation and by catastrophes and as the mostimportant of all causes of organic change is one which is almostindependent of altered and perhaps suddenly altered physical conditions namely the mutual relation of organism to organism the improvement ofone being entailing the improvement or the extermination of others itfollows that the amount of organic change in the fossils of consecutiveformations probably serves as a fair measure of the lapse of actualtime a number of species however keeping in a body might remain for along period unchanged whilst within this same period several of thesespecies by migrating into new countries and coming into competitionwith foreign associates might become modified so that we must notoverrate the accuracy of organic change as a measure of time duringearly periods of the earth s history when the forms of life wereprobably fewer and simpler the rate of change was probably slower andat the first dawn of life when very few forms of the simplest structureexisted the rate of change may have been slow in an extreme degree thewhole history of the world as at present known although of a lengthquite incomprehensible by us will hereafter be recognised as a merefragment of time compared with the ages which have elapsed sincethe first creature the progenitor of innumerable extinct and livingdescendants was created in the distant future i see open fields for far more importantresearches psychology will be based on a new foundation that of thenecessary acquirement of each mental power and capacity by gradation light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history authors of the highest eminence seem to be fully satisfied with the viewthat each species has been independently created to my mind it accordsbetter with what we know of the laws impressed on matter by the creator that the production and extinction of the past and present inhabitantsof the world should have been due to secondary causes like thosedetermining the birth and death of the individual when i view allbeings not as special creations but as the lineal descendants of somefew beings which lived long before the first bed of the silurian systemwas deposited they seem to me to become ennobled judging from thepast we may safely infer that not one living species will transmit itsunaltered likeness to a distant futurity and of the species now livingvery few will transmit progeny of any kind to a far distant futurity for the manner in which all organic beings are grouped shows that thegreater number of species of each genus and all the species of manygenera have left no descendants but have become utterly extinct wecan so far take a prophetic glance into futurity as to foretel that itwill be the common and widely spread species belonging to the largerand dominant groups which will ultimately prevail and procreate newand dominant species as all the living forms of life are the linealdescendants of those which lived long before the silurian epoch we mayfeel certain that the ordinary succession by generation has never oncebeen broken and that no cataclysm has desolated the whole world hence we may look with some confidence to a secure future of equallyinappreciable length and as natural selection works solely by and forthe good of each being all corporeal and mental endowments will tend toprogress towards perfection it is interesting to contemplate an entangled bank clothed with manyplants of many kinds with birds singing on the bushes with variousinsects flitting about and with worms crawling through the damp earth and to reflect that these elaborately constructed forms so differentfrom each other and dependent on each other in so complex a manner have all been produced by laws acting around us these laws taken inthe largest sense being growth with reproduction inheritance which isalmost implied by reproduction variability from the indirect and directaction of the external conditions of life and from use and disuse aratio of increase so high as to lead to a struggle for life and as aconsequence to natural selection entailing divergence of character andthe extinction of less improved forms thus from the war of nature from famine and death the most exalted object which we are capableof conceiving namely the production of the higher animals directlyfollows there is grandeur in this view of life with its severalpowers having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one and that whilst this planet has gone
