it is still speaking more emphatically and widely than ever a brief and comprehensive notice of its manifestations is surely worthy of consideration at the present time it is the intent of this volume to keep in sacred remembrance some of the preachers and defenders of the gospel of godsimpartial grace who in times when it was frowned upon and misrepresented in and out of the churches had the christian courage and loyalty to avow and maintain it they have made the past not dead but gloriously alive in their faith and works in addition to the biographical sketches here given other kindred matter of interest to the general reader will be presented such as the rise and progress of the universalist church in america its growth in agreement with the genius and civilization of our republic

future the reader will understand that the views here taken are from the standpoint of a new england ministersobservation and do not embrace particulars which a wider survey might have included furthermore the author would say that in the account of ministers here given nothing like a complete biographical encyclopædia is intended hence he does not consider himself responsible for what is

doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs and the thoughts of men are widened by the process of the suns tennyson the world moves this is one of the confident sayings of those who believe in human progression it is an ordination of divine providence from the beginning that man should realize mental and moral growth through the successive generations of his earthly life and this divine purpose has been manifest in the past history of our race they who think taking the amplest view of the present condition of mankind any former time was better than the present do not rightfully discriminate if says sydney smith you say that our ancestors were wiser than we mention your date and your year enlightened humanity cannot be content with its present attainments its purest and highest aspirations respond to that clarion word of christian heroism let us go on unto perfection of all the centuries of human history which have yet been numbered none have been more notable than the one in which we are living since its commencement some of the most remarkable changes that can be recorded of any age or period have taken place education art science human government and enterprise religious thought all have made progress nations have changed men have changed if not in nature yet in convictions respecting manscapability obligation and destiny the old world and the new have witnessed these transformations it is of the changes indicative of human progress within the middle of the present century that i desire to speak in this volume for during this period there seems to have been a more rapid succession of them than ever evincing the capability of our race for an advancement to which no philosophy of the past or present has been able to set bounds there have been during this time nobler revolutions than those effected by war by the downfall of governments and dynasties revolutions more excellent and enduring we mean those wrought by human thought investigation discovery and invention apt and forcible are the words of dr norman macleod written at the close of the year in a few hours the century will have lived its threescore and ten years i question if since time began with the exception of three or four great eras such as the calling of abraham the exodus the birth of christ the reformation the invention of printing or it may be the breaking up of the roman empire the birth of mohammed or of buddha such an influential period has existed the invention of the steam engine the discovery of gas telegraph chloroform with the freedom of slaves the british acquisition of india the opening up of the world to the gospel the translations of the scriptures will make it forever memorable equally expressive are the words recently spoken by the chief magistrate of massachusetts think of what has been done in the matter of education of public schools of universities of learning for both sexes and all races in science we have unlocked the secrets of the earth the air and the sea and made them not merely matters of wonder but handmaids of homely use in all matters of comfort of use of elegance of convenient living of house and table and furniture and light and warmth and health and travel what thorough and beneficent advance equally for all shaming the petty meanness with which unjust alike to the old times and the new we inveigh against the new times and overrate the old and what more especially of moral revolution and progress during the last half century the indications are evidently hopeful and cheering human nature is indeed the same but it has been under new and better influences in modern than in more remote time human governments have improved and even the worst of them are better now than they were fifty years ago human laws have been rendered more human and less barbarous sympathy for the poor the degraded the sinful has been more truly awakened and is at this moment in more active operation than at any previous time the moral obligations of political rulers and those who sustain them have been perhaps more vigorously discussed during these years than in any other fifty years preceding so that there seems now a more favorable opportunity than at almost any previous day this side that of the jewish theocracy to impress this truth upon the public mind that if individuals should have consciences and a sense of responsibility to god so should communities that righteousness exalteth a nation while sin is a reproach to any people religious toleration also has increased the rigid sectarianism of the past has been giving way so that now the hunters of heresy and the executioners of those who held it are read of rather than seen the false deity which even some christians have worshipped in the past and the false humanity with which they have supposed themselves endowed have been in some good degree exchanged for more rational conceptions of god the father and of man the offspring and this change is daily going on never was it more perceptible than at the present hour we should manifest an unpardonable blindness in noting these evidences of human advancement if we were to leave out of the account the most significant of all forces in it we mean christianity this we regard as the foremost power in the spiritual progress thus far realized in our world and which promises to effect for the race its highest exaltation refinement and barbarism have more or less marked the history of the world in the past they do still but where does the light of civilization shine brightest among the nations the answer is where the christian religion in its true spirit most widely prevails and it is the increasing prevalence of it which gives us the assurance of that consummation of the redeemerswork with men when they all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of christ christianity is a universal religion herein is its pre eminence it is for man everywhere and in all time no other religion has so clearly asserted this claim for itself and no other promises to do so much for mankind true it has had to make its way against the errors and prejudices and corruptions of the world it has been mixed with human errors and has been professed taught and practised in too many instances by those who have failed to realize clearly the heavenliness of its spirit and its far reaching regenerative and overcoming power its earliest promulgators failed to see at first this grand characteristic of its universality an able christian historian has written nothing is more remarkable than to see the horizon of the apostles gradually receding and instead of resting on the borders of the holy land comprehending at length the whole world barrier after barrier falling down before the superior wisdom which was infused into their minds first the proselytes of the gate the foreign conformists to judaism and ere long the gentiles themselves admitted within the pale until christianity stood forth demanded the homage and promised its rewards to the faith of the whole human race proclaimed itself in language which the world had as yet never heard the one true universal religion rev dr gerhard uhlhorn of germany in his able work the conflict of christianity with heathenism speaking of the early development of christianity in the roman empire calls it the first step to its universalism itself passing out from the ancient narrowness into a world wide breadth of thought and life the old world became capable of accepting the universalism of christianity the old world and the new have yet many steps forward to take in this pathway of a continually increasing brightness oration of governor long before the municipal authorities and citizens of boston july eph iv milmans history of christianity chapter christian un ersalism universalism is a living movement organized out of the grandest ideas and spiritual facts of the universe gathering into itself the richest and mightiest moral forces and working towards the most positive practical ends and a man is a universalist and is the better off for being a universalist only as some sense of what universalism thus is and of the force of its motives and the reality of its work flows down a quickening power into his being brooks the name universalism as connected with christianity has been especially notable during the present century but the principles which it implies were averred by the christian church in its earliest days it signifies godsunchanging paternal interest in all his children an interest insuring his just dealing with them for their obedience or disobedience of his beneficent laws and their final release from sin and life in righteousness under its present name universalism is comparatively recent its special church history being comprehended in something more than a century but its principles and doctrines are as old as the christian records and are found in the old testament teachings just as all the sects in christendom though belonging to modern times profess to trace whatever they may deem essential back to the apostles so believers in universalism make the same reference as one of their number has well stated it if we have no business here because we came so late our neighbors must fall under the same condemnation in mere assumption we are neither younger nor older than they the universalist church claims the new testament as the basis of its doctrines it cites the gospels the apostolic history and the epistles christ and his first ministers as authority for its pretensions after the apostles its lights appear in the early centuries of the christian era dr edward beecher in his able work the scriptural doctrine of future retribution shows that at about the time of origen out of the six theological schools in christendom four taught universal salvation as the faith of the christian church the one at cæsarea the one at antioch the one at alexandria the one at edessa that eminent light of the early church origen who so ably and successfully maintained the claims of christianity against the abusive attacks of the heathen celsus was a universalist so was alexander bishop of jerusalem and gregory thaumaturgus bishop of neocæsarea and so were the most distinguished by piety and learning of the masters of the great theological seminary of the early church the catechetical school at alexandria doederlein said that the more profoundly learned any one was in christian antiquity so much more did he cherish and defend the hope that the suffering of the wicked would at some time come to an end and hagenbach commenting on a remark of augustine says that even that great father of orthodoxy admitted a relative cessation of damnation also gieseler affirms a belief in the unalienable power of amendment in all intelligent beings and the limited duration of future punishment was general in the west and among the opponents of origen of the very time when the influence of origen was so great in the church and when there can be no good reason to doubt the doctrine of universal salvation was held by many if not the majority of christians mr lecky in his history of morals in europe says the christian community exhibited a moral purity which if it has been equalled has never for a long time been surpassed dr schaff says of the condemnation of origen which included the doctrine of universal restoration it was a death blow to theological science in the greek church and left it to stiffen gradually into a mechanical traditionalism and formalism the increased light shed upon ecclesiastical history during the present century shows most clearly the growth of this faith from the first centuries of the christian era to the present time it has increased with the mental and moral progress of mankind with its best civilization what is written for these pages will represent especially the rise and progress of the universalist church in america it is proper however to say that the faith it represents has had growth also in other lands it has long been known in great britain where a few churches have made a distinct avowal of it while individuals scattered here and there have had strong interest in it the unitarians of england generally avow it in the established church faith in the doctrine of endless punishment is not demanded as a condition of church membership while some of its most distinguished leaders have advocated with marked ability the doctrine of the fatherhood of god in full agreement with the doctrine of the final reconciliation of all souls to him we meet with universalism in its essential elements in neander the eminent christian historian and in commentators and scholars in england and on the continent the faith is expressed in the poetry of wordsworth tennyson and others the able ministers coquerel father and son were advocates of it in the reformed church in france paris the leaven of this faith is in individuals the doctrine is often held and openly avowed from the pulpit and through the press as well as in private by a large number of persons in various communions who may have but little knowledge of each other or of the advocacy of this faith elsewhere through special organizations civitate dei lib xxi chap civitate dei lib xxi chap for evidence of the many utterances of the universalist idea in the literature of the past the reader is referred to the volume entitled a cloud of witnesses by rev john hanson chicago chapter i un ersalism in america christianity is recognized as a democratic element profitable for all conditions of men as the declaration of independence and our constitution are the palladium of our civil and religious rights dr francis author of old new york universalism in america took its rise with the republic the coming of john murray to our shores and the proclamation of the gospel of universal grace was but a little time previous to the issuing of the declaration of independence by the american colonies these colonies had come to the full and bold utterance with which the declaration opens we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness through ages of light and of darkness this sacred truth had had but little growth or power in the human mind but it was there and was not to die there it lived through all the worldschange commotion and revolution and the set time had now come when it should have a clearer and stronger expression and demonstration than our old or new worlds had yet known this declaration of our fathers signified the inestimable value of man of every man to himself his fellow man and his god it asserts the doctrine of human equality not that all men have the same intellectual or moral capacities or should possess an equal amount of property or be invested with the same political privileges but the religious doctrine that all are of one blood children of one father protected by one providence made to aid to bless and build each other up in truth justice and righteousness henceforth while the world stands it signifies human equality and human rights in their broadest and most rational sense as wrote alexander hamilton all men have one common origin they participate in a common nature and consequently have one common right no reason can be assigned why one man should exercise any pre eminence among his fellow creatures unless they have voluntarily vested him with it it was this conviction based on a principle that carried our fathers through the revolution and gave to us that constitution which was afterwards the work of their hands the object of this constitution is explicitly declared to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquillity provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity this signified not the growth and strengthening of a sentiment that would justify the building up of one class upon the subjugation of another we have a statement of the whole truth in the emphatic language of mr bancroft as he speaks of the intent of the framers of the declaration on which our constitution is based the declaration avoiding specious and vague generalities grounds itself with anxious care upon the past and reconciles right and fact the assertion of right was made for the entire world of mankind and all coming generations without any exceptions whatever for the proposition which admits of exceptions can never be self evident and as it was put forth in the name of the ascendant people of that time it was sure to make the circuit of the world passing everywhere through the despotic countries of europe and the astonished nations as they read that all men are created equal started out of their lethargy like those who have been exiles from childhood when they suddenly hear the dimly remembered accents of their mother tongue it was meet and right that when this great word went forth to awaken the nations to a new realization there should be heard at the same time in our land the trumpet notes of that gospel which proclaims the unbinding of the heavy burdens of humanity liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound as dr benjamin rush one of the signers of the declaration of independence and a believer in christian universalism in a letter to rev mr winchester alluding to rev john wesley writes his writings will ere long revive in support of our doctrine for if christ died for all as mr wesley always taught it will soon appear as a necessary consequence that all shall be saved at present we wish liberty to the whole world the next touch of the celestial magnet upon the human heart will direct it into wishes for the salvation of all mankind this new political life upon which our nation entered signified the equality true sonship brotherhood capability and earthly destination of man it meant democracy not the democracy of numbers merely nor of political parties struggling for supremacy and the spoils of the victors but a democracy having in view a common good the greatest good of all it means intelligence thrift education and religion for the masses it means this for one people means it for all nations of mankind precisely this is signified by the re affirmation on these western shores of that gospel anciently proclaimed to the athenians by the christian apostle god that made the world hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring a common humanity a common interest and destiny are declared it is a common humanity with which christ is in sympathy which makes him who would be highest in the divine estimation the servant of all which recognizes the golden rule directs the strong to bear the infirmities of the weak and men everywhere to be helpers one of another because their interests are not antagonistic when the laws that govern their nature are clearly understood they have unity what binds one binds all love of things true and right men have too a common interest under the divine guardianship wherever there is a man there is a being in whose soul god has implanted aspirations after himself a propensity to religion a feeling after him which may be misled by superstition or overlaid by ignorance or elevated by knowledge into purest piety but which is yet there wherever he exists the sovereign power holds him in discipline demands an account from him at his tribunal of impartial justice and will not permit him to go out of his hands to whatever heights he ascends god still encompasses him into whatever depths he may fall he is still held by the guardian beneficent power one destiny also is affirmed of this great body of humanity a blessing instituted in the beginning including all families kindreds nations no divine favoritism towards one over another do we see the law and the prophets point towards this universal grace of god to man israel and the gentile world shall alike share it the apocalyptic vision opens it up to the eye of faith and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard i saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever what is this but the fact and the ultimate completeness and glory of the unity of the race one father brotherhood saviour homage destiny other theologies had made distinctions and endless separations in representing mankind had denied as they still deny this fraternal relationship this positive family connection had represented god rather as an arbitrary sovereign than loving father and the divine government a wilful monarchy instead of a just and merciful dispensation under which each soul is of equal value and the good of one is the good of all unbelief has said as in the language of spinoza the right extends as far as the force of the natural right or law jus et institutum naturæ is nothing more than the rules of the nature of each individual the divisions and contentions classes and castes the impositions frauds and oppressions which have more or less marked the social relations of mankind all come of this pernicious error growing out of the unchecked selfishness of the human heart christian universalism forever contradicts this error it affirms that the great body of humanity is one and that it is death to sunder it if one member suffer all the members suffer with it if one rejoice all rejoice together for the body is not one member but many in the affirmation of the gospel religious bigotry and exclusiveness find a constant reproof undue boasting arrogance and pride are hushed by this grand conviction that one is our father who is in heaven and all we are brethren the broadest philanthropy is awakened everywhere in man the world becomes the one great field of effort for the enlightenment relief upraising and perfecting of humanity in the strong and noble words of another universalism and the revolution began to rise together they were rocked together in the same stormy days in the cradle of american liberty the banner of universalism is love let that banner be lifted up it shall symbol yet the true idea of the declaration of independence all men are created equal i look forward to the time when our flag shall wave in unsullied glory not over smoking ruins at the mast head of our battle ships on bloody fields from the parapets of our forts merely but the stars and stripes and the white banner

isaiah xl rev john murray from england landed on the shore of new jersey in he came hither much oppressed in spirit on account of severe afflictions in england and had determined not to place himself before the public again as a preacher his published biography tells us how differently the arrangements were made by providence respecting him it is a remarkable record that of his meeting with thomas potter who declared that he had been long waiting for the minister who had now come that he must preach in the new meeting house which had been builded for him and who in face of the preachersrefusal to comply with his request declared that the wind would not change for him to leave in the vessel until he had delivered his message after a severe mental conflict the stranger consented to preach on the following sunday due notice was given and the house was filled with attentive listeners there had been some other preaching of universalism in different places in america previous to this time as there were here and there those who cherished the faith and made public avowal of it dr george de benneville a fugitive from france because of religious persecution established himself near germantown pa as a physician and being a devout believer in universalism took occasion often to advocate it in public with much effect this beginning on the part of mr murray however opened the way to a systematic permanent movement and led to the establishment of universalist churches he preached much in new england and was settled in portsmouth and afterwards in boston where he remained pastor of one church for nearly thirty years in his preaching at first mr murray did not design to establish a separate sect he was welcomed by ministers and their followers into orthodox pulpits until his outspoken views respecting the salvation of the race raised a strong opposition against him which made him an object of persecution and marked him as the propagator of a dangerous heresy thus excluded from christian communion and fellowship by other sects it was but reasonable and just that the believers in universalism should assume for themselves the rights and privileges of a distinct and independent christian fraternity so that other sects were responsible for the separation of this branch of the christian church from themselves it has been justly said by another if there was sin in this schism in this separate religious organization it was a sin for which the other sects of those times should bear the blame they turned us out of doors because we dared express our earnest solemn opinions and we had only these two alternatives to stay out of doors or go in at those which were hung on universalist hinges does anybody to day condemn us because we chose the latter we do not uncharitably condemn them for the course they took they acted in most cases conscientiously and it was perhaps a providential necessity of the times that the two elements should separate that the two classes of christians holding views so opposite should walk apart for a while denied the fellowship of other churches at the start we have tried to be content with the fellowship of christ and we neither desire nor ask for any other until we are deemed worthy of it that we can endure to be called heretics even infidels that we can stand alone and yet live and grow and win the respect of the best part of the world is already demonstrated our great anxiety in the future will be to show to all right minded people by our life rather than our word that we are christians that this last form of protestantism is only more genuine because nearer the truth than the first contemporary with mr murray during his early ministry in america were elhanan winchester a highly gifted and effective minister thomas jones formerly of the lady huntington connection in england and afterwards settled at gloucester mass adams and zebulon streeter caleb rich thomas barnes noah parker noah murray george richards william farwell joab young hosea and david ballou edward turner most of these preachers in new england abel sargent in western pennsylvania and a few others dr joseph priestley was for a time in philadelphia where he advocated the doctrine of the final restoration of all souls and rev dr mayhew and rev dr chauncey although not identified with the work of the ministers already mentioned had made distinct avowals of this same faith a remarkable fact in connection with the history of most of these men is that they were not from theological schools nor largely endowed with literary qualifications they were men of clear mental perceptions were well versed in the bible ready and apt in their references to it of sincere convictions and of indomitable will they went forth in readiness for whatever encounters might await them never fearing what theological forces might appear in their way so long as they felt assured that the sword of the spirit would not fail them and that they should be made strong in the lord and victorious in his might well has it been written it will be brave reading when somebody shall display to us how the faith came quietly to exist at far distant points pennsylvania new york new england variously born of widely different antecedents but gradually converging to a general likeness by the time john murray came to be the nucleus around which all should centre an organic but unorganized mass without form but not void then will follow the long history of separated and desultory warfare with the established prejudices and partialities of the christian sects during which every verse of scripture was discussed every doctrine examined from the base every conventional habit of thought dragged to the light and called to account every inch of theological ground stubbornly fought over all this while there were annual meetings called the general convention and recognized as a centre of denominational union but they were little more than voluntary mass meetings all authority was jealously reserved to societies or local associations with the largest liberty of individual preference and universalists like israel under its judges did as seemed good in every manssight men in less deadly earnest or dealing with doctrines less profound and fundamental would have formed a close compact early in their history but it was in the nature of the case that these revolted thinkers should be shy of new bonds and that these divers searching the deeps should think little of the surface it was only when there came to be multitudes born in the faith with intellectual habits and social affinities based on universalism with established worship and gathered congregations scattered across the continent that the imperative need of a firm union for work and discipline was felt and to reach this point had taken almost a hundred years as time passes and new phases of the church representing the universalist faith appear and new advocates of it arise these days of its first advocacy in our land may lose their significance to many minds in the increasing attractions connected with the same church in the present time but he who would see most clearly the hand of divine providence in the breaking of the light of this new dispensation upon our shores will hold in just and sacred estimation this day of small things when these faithful ones stood forth to declare its glad tidings so graphically have the words of another given the deserved tribute to their works that we gladly record them in these pages the early defenders of universalism were plain earnest men aroused to the exertion of all their energies by the presence of a great thought the truth of godsuniversal love and benevolent purpose in creation possessed them they saw it everywhere prefigured in hebrew types predicted by the prophets implied in every word of jesus enforced in every letter of his apostles they taught it in all places and by all methods in parish churches and district school houses in fields and workshops in pulpits with stones flying about their heads in rooms filled with the odor of nauseous drugs in face of the reckless slander of the undignified and the quiet contempt of the dignified portion of the clergy they were armed at all points like the old war engines that overturned every moment always stood right side up they turned the tables upon the literal calvinistic interpreters and held a text to floor every opponent they were not moved by ridicule for they possessed a keen sense of the ludicrous and knew well how to expose the absurdities of the piebald theology of the churches to the threats of their opponents they opposed hudibrastic rhymes to their missiles words like old murrays while i have a thus saith the lord for every point of doctrine which i advance not all the stones in boston except they stop my breath shall shut my mouth or arrest my testimony to the arguments of their adversaries a logic like that of ballou simple as the talk of a little child strong as the tramp of a giant there were varieties of opinion among them they had not all come up to the mount of their elevation by the same path but the sublime truth god is love burned like an undying flame in their souls and united them like brothers thank god that the sleep of the church was awakened by these strong champions nobly they spake their words in days when it was a disgrace in the eyes of men rev tuttle rev smith dodge rev a mayo sermon at funeral of rev thomas jones of gloucester mass chapter growth day by day the doctrine of the eternity of evil is being driven into its native night before a higher view of the nature of god and a nobler belief in him as the undying righteousness rev stopford a brooke at the beginning of the present century thirty years from the time of mr murraysfirst preaching in america there were a few more than twenty preachers of universalism here by the year there were forty in there were four hundred and sixty three at the present time our church register reports the number seven hundred and thirty and this increase of ministerial force is not the most noticeable fact in connection with the advancement of this faith other instrumentalities are to be taken into the account as the preacher at the centenary meeting of the national convention stated our lists latterly have been more closely pruned our parishes have been greatly strengthened our bases of operations have been fortified our clergy have made great advances in devising liberal things and our laity possessing far greater wealth and holding far higher social positions than formerly more nobly respond and with greater alacrity to the far sighted demands now so frequently made upon them there are scores of our parishes in the various sections of our zion any one of which can now be moved to a greater work for a worthy object outside its own interests than could our whole church twenty five years ago educational improvements have also contributed to this favorable change at first there were no theological seminaries nor academies in aid of this faith in process of time these grew up and were made serviceable in the promotion of it so that now not less than seven academies five colleges including three professional schools two of divinity and one of law having an aggregate property of more than two millions of dollars are to be counted among its working forces the publications in the interests of this faith have had large increase books pamphlets tracts weekly and monthly journals and the quarterly commentaries on the scriptures together with well sustained publishing houses are additional influences constantly in operation to aid the efforts of the ministry the murray centenary fund projected in is designed to aid in the education of the clergy the circulation of denominational literature and in church extension this fund amounted oct to the womanscentenary aid association was organized in to assist in raising the murray fund and was incorporated sept it is supported wholly by voluntary contributions and annual memberships these are all evidences of life and advancement and indicate a larger increase in the future which may be realized with a zeal in operation like that which has effected the change already noted of the theological changes realized since the opening of the present century what shall we say and all of them indicating an approach to this very faith of which we are speaking when murray and his contemporaries entered upon their work in america the old calvinistic theology had almost undisputed sway here and for fifty years afterwards it was more or less so but since up to the present time including the middle of this century the advancement in theological thought has been as marked as have these other changes and signs of progress to which we have alluded true arminianism came in with the methodistic movement and made vigorous warfare upon the old theology with its five points so tenaciously adhered to but methodism held fast that abominable dogma eternal punishment and failed to see godspurposes any more effective in the final salvation of souls than did calvinism with its full assurance of the salvation of the elect only the arminian deity seems to have had no fixed purpose as to the number of the finally redeemed though he foreknew he was not pleased to ordain or in the words of dr adam clarke i conclude that god although omniscient is not obliged in consequence of this to know all that he can know the god of calvin though having a determinate will appeared as a tyrannical sovereign the god of arminius as lacking in purpose and in power the one made the salvation of a certain number sure the other left all in uncertainty because so much depended solely on the will of the creature the two systems summed up however amounted to universalism the one affirmed that every soul for whom christ died would be saved the other that christ by the grace of god tasted death for every man opposed as were the two sects representing these theologies in the beginning they have settled down into quite a fraternal compromise during the last half century pulpit exchanges are free among their ministers and although here and there some of the old peculiarities of calvinism occasionally find utterance the statement of a noted congregationalist minister seems to express the thought of both parties election means whosoever will reprobation whosoever wont it was in face of what were deemed the main errors of both these theologies that universalism stood forth as the vindicator of god the just and merciful father of all his children their judge and saviour through christ who gave himself a ransom for all and whose own expressive statement of the result of his ministry was and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me it has been during the ministry of this faith in the present century that the leading doctrines of the theology formerly prevalent in our land have been questioned investigated and in many minds outgrown who now believes in the endless suffering of infants a doctrine deemed unquestionable in the churches a century ago even the existence of it at that time in face of the most stubborn facts has been denied by those whose parents and grandparents heard it from the christian pulpit who assents to the doctrine of the total depravity of human nature its inability to do a good deed or think a good thought and its utter odiousness in godssight what considerations and reconsiderations are there of that doctrine of atonement which involves the assumption that god was so incensed against his sinful children that christ the second and more merciful person in the godhead came into the world and died to appease the wrath of god and render it possible for him to be merciful to the delinquents and how much more emphatic is the conviction finding utterance so eminently expressive of christian universalism god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved and the doctrine of endless punishment how during the time of which we are speaking has this been questioned in the churches of our land it has been seen that the divine character is involved in this doctrine and that one of the most difficult of all theological works is to vindicate this character in the light of it formerly it was deemed little short of impiety to question the justice of god when this horrible doctrine was represented as an indication and vindication of it to cite emphatically the passage in matthew xxv these shall go away into everlasting punishment but the righteous into life eternal was considered evidence enough that the divine justice could and would be signalized in the utter banishment of great numbers of his children from him world without end to question the exegesis of the passage as generally given the original meaning of the word rendered everlasting and eternal was regarded as a direct affront to the human wisdom of the past that had sanctioned it and to declare such an explanation of it as derogatory to the eternal goodness was to question the veracity of the high and holy one but the thoughts of men have kept at work inquiry has gone on the old explanation has been most confidently and emphatically denied and a more reasonable and consistent one given even the most respectable orthodoxy itself has conceded that the aionian punishment here set forth is not necessarily to be understood as implying endless duration and that in the argument henceforth against the doctrine of universal restoration this old interpretation of the text need be no longer urged we have reserved a more extended view of this subject however for the

built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief corner stone eph ii since the growth of the universalist faith during the present century in our country that phase of liberal christianity denominated unitarianism has had its rise it was an outcome of the arminianism in orthodox churches it advocated the doctrine of the unity of god in opposition to that of the trinity as held by most of the churches in new england it also rejected the doctrine of total depravity affirming that man had within him the germs of goodness and needed the work of christian culture to insure his true religious growth and perfection respecting the destination of man beyond the grave it had no uniform affirmation its leading ministers drs channing dewey gannett and others were undecided as to this great question dr channing uttered his protest against the horrible thought of interminable suffering as affirmed by the dominant sects while his statements respecting the wasted and ill spent life make it an impassable gulf from our creator and from pure and happy beings a consuming fire and undying worm dr gannett has similar opinions self reproach exclusion from the happiness of heaven removal from the favor of god to live but to suffer to feel onesself at variance with all that is true and good and beautiful in the universe what more it is eternity will disclose rev mr alger thinks no fair critic can say that a eternal or everlasting when applied to punishment means absolutely endless nor on the other hand that it does not so mean the late rev sears writes that it is the average opinion of unitarians that restoration is not a doctrine of revelation the american unitarian association said while we do generally hold to the doctrine of the final universality of salvation as a consistent speculation of the reason and a strong belief of the heart yet we deem it to be in each case a matter of contingency always depending on conditions freely to be accepted or rejected the editor of the monthly religious magazine the principal of that class published by unitarians writes in unitarians do not believe in universal restoration as a doctrine of revelation fairly yielded by the interpretation of the scriptures this we mean is the average opinion they do not think the bible gives any verdict as to the final salvation of all mankind dr dewey in later times as in his discourse in the volume of pitt street chapel lectures has defined the doctrine of the paternity of god so as to seem in agreement with that of the final salvation of all souls and at the present time perhaps the largest number of unitarian ministers would not hesitate to give their assent to this doctrine on philosophical or scriptural grounds for the full and clear affirmation of the doctrine of the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man the former giving assurance of a merciful care of godsoffspring and the latter of the final union and not separation of the great human family we are indebted to the fathers of universalism in our land murray the ballous the streeters and their contemporaries the universalism which they declared and defended was that of the absolute and universal reign of divine love love that is ever calling the child to obedience and happiness and warning him against the inevitable and dire consequences of transgression love that sent jesus christ into the world as the worldsregenerator unto whom every knee shall bow and whom every tongue shall confess to be lord to the glory of god the father love that can and will overcome all hatred make an end of sin destroy death and bring in everlasting righteousness this is the universalism that has led the way in this great advance and change of theological thought in the new england and other churches which is so widespread at this hour it did not wait for public opinion to be ready for it but went out on its mission confronting as determined an opposition as has ever met any rising sect since the apostolic days its first advocates and most of those who have succeeded them have had a definite theology a positive faith to affirm they have declared it to the world as the best the pre eminent faith standing not in the wisdom of men but in the power of god and have asked as they are still asking all the churches and all the world to show them a better if they are able to do so the sincere believers in this faith of the gospel are glad to welcome all other christians who would work with them in the eradication of religious error and the enlightenment of men by the word of god that liveth and abideth forever for what the unitarian churches have done of this work they have reason to be thankful and would heartily co operate with them in every effort to this desirable and heavenly end the literary culture and scholarship contributed by unitarians to the theological thought of the last half century as also the faithful and efficient work which they have accomplished are we think justly appreciated by universalists they would render to all their dues while they would humbly but righteously claim their own it has been a subject of regret on their part this was inevitable that in consideration of the rationalism so called which has so marked this period unitarians could not have taken a more positive and united stand in regard to the divine authority of christianity as made known in the scriptures of the old and new testaments since rev theodore parker avowed his rationalism and began his sunday worship service in boston it has seemed to most universalists as it has to not a few unitarians that a more definite theology and an avowed basis of its claims have been called for on the part of those who would displace old errors and establish the older truth of the christian gospel so that when the question is honestly asked as it often may be what is the difference between universalism and unitarianism the answer need not necessarily be another question what kind of unitarianism such a diversity of opinion as must abound where there is no theological basis of christian fellowship in any sect or fraternity must fail to give it that concentrated power of christian truth so evidently needed to turn a perverted world right side up in its religious faith and life the universalist church has all along been aware of this need of a substantial basis of christian faith in order to its vitality and success when the rationalism of mr parker was attracting the attention of the public a vigorous discussion came up in the universalist journals of the time whether a man should be sustained as a christian minister who denies the peculiarly divine character of christ and the account given of his miracles in the scriptures and of his resurrection from the dead the adjourned session of the boston association at cambridgeport in december gave special attention to this subject the resolution presented at a former session a few months before at lynn and now again reported was this resolved that this association express its solemn conviction that in order for one to be regarded as a christian minister with respect to faith he must believe in the bible account of the life teachings miracles death and resurrection of the lord jesus christ the resolution was sustained by a very large majority of the clergy and laity it was a plain and honest utterance and gave the christian world to understand the position of the universalist church in regard to authoritative christianity as might have been expected there was still much discussion as to the grounds of true christian fellowship it was followed up quite earnestly for a time by universalists the question of chief interest was is not the faith of the heart affections of more importance than the faith of the intellect shall not the good man have christian fellowship whatever his theological opinions may be in the light of the apostolic statement the letter killeth it is the spirit that giveth life is not the spirit of primary interest and the letter comparatively inconsequential to which it was replied that the spirit of a religion is to be most clearly understood by the letter which explains it that the faith of the intellect and that of the heart should correspond in order to the most perfect christian discipleship that the good man may be found in all religious communities but that a good mohammedan or brahman could not properly claim christian fellowship not receiving christ as the pre eminent teacher of divine truth dr a peabody of the unitarian church very fairly stated the subject in a discourse given by him at the time of which we speak one question is whether those who take opposite views of the authenticity of the christian miracles shall recognize each other as good men and the other whether they shall give each other countenance as christian teachers the former question i am prepared to answer with a cordial yes the latter with an unhesitating and an unqualified no about the same time there appeared in the universalist quarterly for october from the pen of its able editor rev dr hosea ballou an article on the faith requisite to christian fellowship the subject is sounded to its depths and presented in all its bearings clear as light and plain and conclusive as logic can make it and all in a spirit of the utmost candor it has never been answered it may not be improper to speak in this connection of one who in the beginning of his public life appeared as a minister in the unitarian communion but who afterwards very conscientiously left the ministry and became a literary author and public lecturer and who acquired a fame everywhere acknowledged in the civilized world as one of its eminent lights and leaders mr ralph waldo emerson as an author lecturer and reformer he has made an indelible impression on the minds of men during the last half century the foremost thinkers acknowledged their indebtedness to him in his earlier days many of his statements indicated pantheistic opinions his discourse before the divinity school in harvard university in so clearly and ably replied to by rev dr ware seemed a singular questioning of the personality of god and his statements in reference to the personal immortality of the soul hardly indicated a strong christian hope of this blessing but in his later expressions of opinion we are differently taught his biographer says of him he is not a sceptic or a rationalist in the philosophic sense and has no real affinity with any of these schools of thought his own words indicative of the deity are nature is too thin a screen the glory of the creator breaks in everywhere there is no chance no anarchy in the universe of the divine beneficence he says we see the steady aim of benefit in view from the first melioration is the law the evils we suffer will at last end themselves through the incessant opposition of nature to everything hurtful and of immortality all great natures delight in stability all great men find eternity affirmed in the very promise of their faculties the being that can share a thought and a feeling so sublime as confidence in truth is no mushroom our dissatisfaction with any other solution is the blazing evidence of immortality and of the divine ruling every wrong is punished no moral evil can prosper at last the good is absolute the evil only phenomenal and of the significance of christ this language is emphatic you must not leave out the word christian for to leave out that is to leave out everything all these declarations as we apprehend them are in perfect accord with the teaching spirit and assurance of the universalism of the new testament in the grandest conceptions to which their author has given utterance we know of nothing that reaches beyond this and it is for this that we welcome him as a witness to the truth of the christian gospel the volume on the atonement issued in by rev hosea ballou was the first of any note in this country in which the subordination of christ to the father was maintained dr mayhew and rev james freeman of boston had already preached anti trinitarian views in that city and dr priestley and a mr butler had preached them in other parts of the country but mr ballouscircumstances had not it is likely allowed him to know what these men believed and taught rev dr a putnam in religious magazine april mr parkersviews were the subject of special note and examination on the part of the universalist journals a candid and able review of his opinions was given in the universalist miscellany of april by the editor rev a skinner rev mr lothrop of the brattle square church unitarian delivered and published a strong discourse in opposition to the rationalism of mr parker anti supernaturalism a sermon delivered july before the senior class of the divinity school harvard university biography of

works in faith for the worldsredemption rev brooks the increasing interest awakened by the discussion of such topics of reform as peace temperance human freedom the treatment of criminals and others involving the moral uplifting and advancement of mankind very naturally had its effect upon the universalist church there were not a few in it who saw very clearly that the great gospel in which they believed was in the world to do a regenerative work with the human family that its first word to every one to whom it came was the call to reformation of character and life that it was a direct and perpetual opposition to all that hinders this work and that therefore they who profess to be its friends and advocates should embrace every opportunity of applying its heavenly forces to the diminishing of human wrong and the establishing of the reign of righteousness in the earth as other churches were awakened and agitated on these reform questions so was this one and in due time it took its stand and made its manifestations in a way creditable to its profession and in accordance with its hopeful and catholic faith one of the organizations for the furtherance of this work of christian reform instituted by this church was that of the universalist reform association the first direct action taken in reference to the subject was at the session of the massachusetts universalist convention in hingham june when the following resolution offered by rev fay of roxbury was unanimously adopted resolved that this convention recommend to the universalists of new england to form an association to be known as the new england universalist reform association which shall meet annually in boston during anniversary week having for its object the collection of such statistical information relative to the various reform movements of the age as illustrates not only the progress of christianity as we understand it but the best means of promoting and applying it a committee was chosen to carry the resolution into effect an appointed sub committee issued a circular urging upon all interested attention to the main objects of the association which were to consider the influence of universalist sentiments in the various reform movements of the age it must be evident that these sentiments are not essentially confined to the sect which openly professes them we hold that they lie at the foundation of every true effort for the prevalence of temperance love peace freedom and all movements which recognize the paternity of god and the brotherhood of man to establish the truth of the ultimate connection of these doctrines with all the philanthropic action of our age to collect statistics and facts which demonstrate it and to exchange sentiments upon the subject constitute one great object of the association to assume our appropriate position in relation to these reforms to exert our legitimate influence in them and to show in our actions the practical conclusion of universalist premises that he who believes in godsuniversal paternity and the brotherhood of the race cannot in any way countenance war intemperance slavery or capital punishment but consistently opposes and strives to abolish them all the time of holding the meeting too deserves consideration it is on anniversary week a week when almost every moral question now agitating the civilized world is represented and discussed in boston hitherto we have sent out no such influence on this occasion as we believe we may exert if our power shall be concentrated and put in operation we see not why our reform meetings may not be among the most interesting of all now held during this well known season and they were they began successfully and were steadily and profitably held up to during years when these vital moral questions were more intensely considered and debated in new england and throughout our land than at any previous period very carefully prepared and able reports were year by year presented to the association and resolutions involving the merits of these reformatory topics freely and amicably discussed often in other meetings conventions associations conferences where ecclesiastical matters claimed the chief attention the introduction of these reformatory subjects would cause uneasiness and elicit much fault finding on the part of those opposed to the introduction of such agitative themes into these meetings of the church but at the yearly assemblings of the reform association the largest liberty was taken by all who desired to express their opinions on these great questions of the day the first meeting was a success it was held in the second universalist church school street on thursday may four addresses were given on these subjects peace criminal reform temperance and human freedom and appropriate resolutions discussed and adopted in connection with this session a social festival was held on friday morning and was an occasion of unusual enjoyment to all who took part in it the historian richard frothingham esq presided and made an admirable opening address he was followed by others among them chapin then of rising fame pretending to have in hand only skirts and fragments of ideas he magically forms them into completeness and endues them with power he speaks of christianity and reform christianity has not changed or added anything to itself but we find in it latent truths we discern new meaning in old truths his eye had rested that very morning upon the passage which jesus read in the synagogue at nazareth the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord what a profound meaning does this passage receive now in the light of these stirring reforms how does the truth open before us vast and deep as the blue heaven over our heads christianity authorizes and animates these social movements its social spirit and its labors of love make us live more in a year than elsewhere in a lifetime the early fathers of our faith began their labor in the early morning when the light of the truth they announced just tinged the mountain tops and now as they are about vanishing from our horizon the full effulgence shines upon their gray hairs and makes them a crown of glory the venerable ballou made the concluding speech his words were modest sweet and patriarchal from that ancient saying of jesus the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was leavened he brought out fresh and comprehensive words inspired by the scenes of yesterday and to day and eloquently urged home the admonition to his denominational children around him that they should seek to accomplish all their reformatory work in the spirit of christian love he concluded and at the word of the president the brave old oak was sung and responded to by the applause of the audience from year to year as these meetings occurred there was a strong interest in them they were meetings where freedom of speech was welcomed and enjoyed the most searching inquiry was invited and the pro et contra of every resolution offered was presented in all the earnestness in which the debaters deemed it their privilege to indulge the resolutions at the first meetings of the association indicate its christian basis they are expressive of gratitude to god in view of the development of our faith in all the great reform movements of the time that we recognize the word of god especially the new testament scripture as the basis of all genuine reform that an age as prolific as is the present in schemes for the improvement of the race including such variety from the most reasonable to the most utopian demands of every christian the most candid and prayerful discrimination that all his endeavors may be wisely directed that in these movements we discern the promise of a better time coming and of the kingdom of god upon the earth that as religious sentiment is the controlling element of manslife therefore the only true reform is that which seeks to influence men through the medium of religious faith in discussing topics involving the morals of politics and the great interests of the american republic the members of all political parties were regarded as on equal ground the minister in these meetings had no hesitancy in preaching the morals of politics as he understood them whatever the opinions of his parishioners at home might be the religion of christianity was mixed with politics as the larger quantity and wrong as wrong arraigned wherever it might be found in church or state in social or individual habit or life our public servants in their high places were deemed subjects of note and animadversion if their conduct seemed to call for it in the spirit of the prayer offered by the elder dr beecher in faneuil hall lord preserve us from speaking evil of our public servants and especially save them from such wrong conduct as may call for such speaking on our part a resolution passed at the first meeting of the association states that while the early christians were only subjects american citizens are the constituents of civil government and in all ages christians are bound to act the christian principles in all their relations during the anti slavery excitement when the hunters for fugitive slaves were desecrating the ground of new england and members of congress in their interests were repealing the missouri compromise and many of the ministers of new england were bold enough to remonstrate with them for such action these most emphatic resolutions were freely debated and unanimously adopted by the association resolved that the clergymen of new england in their protest against the repeal of the missouri compromise have pledged themselves anew to freedom and the laws of god that this association cordially approve the course of those who signed the protest or otherwise labored to prevent the desecration of that vast territory which had been consecrated by solemn compact to liberty forever and we request those christian ministers who refused to sign that protest to review their position in regard to this subject resolved that the men from the north and especially from new england who have voted for the iniquitous nebraska bill have proved themselves traitors to the cause of freedom and to the most hallowed traditions of our fathers and that their conduct deserves the united unqualified perpetual reprobation of all friends to human rights which reprobation should be emphatically expressed at the ballot box the annual festivals held in those days in boston by the universalists were essentially pervaded by the spirit of this association the sentiments songs and speeches on these occasions were alive with the reformatory inspiration of the christian gospel the signs of the times were clearly recognized by the speakers and whatever the especial excitement of the day might be it was sure to find a sympathetic tongue and ear at the festival table the festival in occurring about the time of the rendition of anthony burns the anti slavery feeling was at white heat when the company entered faneuil hall and were taking their seats some sensitively conservative brethren could not suppress the expression of their wishes that no allusion might be made to that event in the addresses about to follow but the current was so irresistibly in one direction that these fearful pleadings were as the smallest eddies therein the notes of freedom made the old hall ring this circular was signed by the sub committee rev adams and rev chapin chapteri new england anti slavery society un ersalist protest what concord hath christ with belial cor vi the new england anti slavery society was one of the most vigorous and persistent bodies that ever appeared on these western shores as a reformatory institution its chief leader was the indomitable garrison who had vowed that on the vexed question of american slavery he would be heard and whose liberator was making its journeys from a boston press throughout the land hailed and patronized by a goodly company in the north denounced as incendiary at the south where a large sum was offered for the head of its editor he had sympathetic companions of a persistency equal to his own wendell phillips edmund quincy samuel sewell rogers stephen foster john pierpont theodore parker parker pillsbury frederick douglass and remond among the men of new england and the tappans of new york and representatives at the annual gatherings from philadelphia baltimore and washington lucretia mott and abby kelley afterwards mrs foster were among the women expounders of this gospel of freedom and anniversary week in boston was made especially notable by their gatherings at marlboro chapel and faneuil hall no matter what other meetings on that week were dull there was always an exuberance of liveliness at the anti slavery convention eloquence is dog cheap at marlboro chapel said ralph waldo emerson and it was no better could be heard on the continent the hardest and boldest resolutions were usually up for consideration denouncing slaveholders and all their abettors political ecclesiastical of whatever standing or profession church and state alike were subjects of their maledictions their defiance of all opposition had a clarion ring in it nothing pleased them more than to have their positions questioned or assailed the adventurous wight who was willing to appear as a condemner of their doctrines was the very one for whom they were looking and for whose presence and opposition they were profoundly thankful their meetings were electrifying such debates and orations such questionings and rejoinders such hymns and spiritual songs too sung often by the hutchinsons to the old tunes of amherst lenox and new jerusalem we hear them now they brought the shouts and tears we remember a scene in marlboro chapel one afternoon during anniversary week there came up for debate the question does the constitution of the united states justify slavery rev john pierpont took the negative and very logically maintained it for more than an hour he appeared in the greatness of his strength and at the close of his argument proposed to those of his auditors who wished to question his statements and never was seen a hungrier company of interrogators than then and there came upon him but he was unmoved as a sea rock in the midst of the breakers his side of the question was not popular with most of the speakers and their sympathizers there and he was subjected to a most searching cross questioning but he came out triumphantly as it seemed through it all when three or four would speak at once he would say one at a time friends the millersrule holds first come first served i desire to hear you all the afternoon sunshine suddenly blazing in from one of the windows upon his face he aptly remarked some subjects are involved in impenetrable darkness but here we seem to have a super abundance of light when the last inquirer had been answered the speaker asked are you all through and no other one questioning he said and now after the fashion of the good old divines i come to the improvement under which head he carefully and briefly reviewed the substance of the debate it was a masterly plea but the end was not yet there was an evening meeting again the hall was filled to listen to a reply to mr pierpont by wendell phillips the orator was in his best mood and his silvery speech kept the audience spell bound it was a complete refutation of the arguments adduced in the afternoon a clergyman sitting near to mr pierpont said to him how can his arguments be answered to which the latter replied i should like to see the man who could tell me so greek met greek in those stirring and stormy days it was an up hill movement this anti slavery agitation it called out spirits of more colors than those mentioned in macbeth the opposition was intense garrisonslife was in peril in the streets of boston in and a little company of his sympathizers including the poet whittier and george thompson the english philanthropist were closely followed in the streets of concord one evening that they might be seized by certain mobocratic ones and subjected to an immersion in some liquid coloring of transient if not indelible black but the hounded ones escaped preserving white menscomplexions they were not to be put down by mobs nor frightened by any human opposition they had the spirit of luther as he went to the diet at worms though the pro slavery devils were thick as the tiles on the houses they proposed to fight them in the name of god and humanity politicians could do nothing with them and the churches generally discarded them there was no love lost however between them and the churches the churches did not give them credit for the good they were seeking to do and they had no words of approval for the humanity of the churches even the national constitution was denounced as a covenant with death and an agreement with hell and the churches were accused as upholders of this covenant so they reasoned not always however in that charity which the new testament commends there were those in the churches as strongly opposed to slavery as themselves but they were slow to recognize action against it outside of their own organizations who could say as did dr gannett of the unitarian church in principle i am with you but there are those with whom you are connected persons who seem to me so to distrust the goodness of all others who differ from them and to look down upon all such with so great a consciousness of moral superiority that i feel myself when in their presence to be in a situation not unlike that of a criminal before his accuser and judge at one time they held an anti sabbath convention for a few days in boston during which they said many hard things against the sanctity of this seventh day worship time evidently because they could thus castigate the churches for refusing to discuss freely on this day the crying sin of american slavery it seemed a pity to hear such harsh denunciations by the speakers who were advocating a righteous cause against an institution that had done so much towards the worldstrue civilization but this was one of their methods of carrying on the reform a leading spirit in this movement in the granite state was nathaniel rogers for a few years the editor of the herald of freedom issued at concord he was a lawyer of plymouth grafton county and a member of the orthodox church in that town and was a descendant of him who was burned at smithfield and had the martyr spirit of his noted ancestor he was a scholarly witty and affable man and wielded as facile a pen as any editor in new england in many of his descriptive sketches he gave to the scenery of new hampshire a fascination equal to that with which sir walter scott invests the lochs and hills of scotland his plea with mr webster the great senator from massachusetts to let his lion voice in one numidian roar be heard from his place in congress on the abomination of american slavery and the claims of american freedom once read could never be forgotten when his herald of freedom was first issued some of the stage drivers from concord refused to carry it out to the subscribers but this hostility through the personal influence of the editor soon ceased its columns were opened to all sorts of radical sayings against the churches because of their presumed hostility to human freedom but as the columns of the paper were free there were sometimes sound and strong answers to them mr rogers worn out with mental toiling and anxiety was called from the earthly life in the midst of his years and so this work of the anti slavery reformers went steadily forward with increasing momentum till a more general awakening took place all over the land the churches were becoming more and more alive to it and the politicians could in no wise evade it the seed of free soilism sown know nothingism sprang up and one of the two leading political parties became the party of freedom of free soil free speech free men the passage and attempted enforcement of the fugitive slave act and the repeal of the missouri compromise had served to bring about this result hence the election of mr lincoln to the presidency secession war the downfall of slavery these first agitators lived to see the end they had striven for attained they had been heard and a stronger than they had heard and had answered them and an imploring and struggling nation in the day of his power now could one of the first of our poets sing ring and swing bells of joy on morningswing send the song of praise abroad with a sound of broken chains tell the nations that he reigns who alone is lord and god of course the universalist churches could not evade this controversy between freedom and slavery their very faith invited and encouraged it the fatherhood of god and the brotherhood of man are doctrines which forever stand in opposition to the presumption that man can own property in his fellow man of all the christian sects universalists were the last who could countenance in the light of their beneficent faith the abomination of american slavery if other theologies gave cause for the aspersion that god was the greatest slaveholder in the universe because it was his intention to keep in spiritual bondage and sufferings great numbers of his offspring world without end universalism affirmed that this whole human creation now groaning and travailing in pain shall be delivered from its bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god could this church bearing its own significant name be silent then when the test time came nay it was a golden opportunity for her to speak and act she uttered her voice firmly freely faithfully true there were conservatives at first in this church as in others who dreaded the consequences of the agitation of this subject who deemed it a political question rather than a religious one and feared not only discord and division in the churches because of it but a disruption of the national union this timidity wore off in due time and this manifesto went forth from the universalists of massachusetts and other states in it is a protest against american slavery and is signed by three hundred and four universalist clergymen the reasons stated as the basis of the protest are these because slavery denies the eternal distinction between a man and property ranking a human being with a material thing because it does not award to the laborer the fruits of his toil in any higher sense than to the cattle because it trammels the intellectual powers and prevents their expansion because it checks the development of the moral nature of the slave denies him rights and therefore responsibility because it involves a practical denial of the religious nature of the slave because it presents an insurmountable barrier to the propagation of the great truth of the universal brotherhood and thereby most effectually prevents the progress of true christianity because the essential nature of slavery cannot be altered by any kindness how great so ever practised toward the slave because the long continuance of a system of wrong cannot palliate it but on the other hand augments the demand for its abolition because we would in all charity remember that peculiarities of situation may affect the judgment and moral sense still we must not forget that no peculiarity of situation can excuse a perpetual denial of universal principles and obligations memoir of dr gannett by his son heb viii chapter reformatory progress the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain isaiah xl the half century just passed has been notable for the progress of thought in reference to the significant reforms now claiming public attention foremost among these is that of temperance in no other period of the past has its work been so marked and cheering in great britain and america its manifestations were almost simultaneous intemperance was seen to be a monstrous national vice and societies were formed for the suppression of it abstinence from distilled liquors was at first the pledge taken but subsequent discussion of the subject induced the next and safer step forward of total abstinence from all intoxicants from to nearly the whole of the original societies through england and scotland extended their principles on the new and broader declaration and worked with renewed enthusiasm the same course was taken in our own country and similar effects followed the new pledge was consistent because it struck at the root of the evil the temperance reform enlisted the sympathies of universalists in the beginning it was a vindication of the gospel of enlightened and pure manhood maintaining its supremacy over the sinful inclinations and indulgences that war against the soul indeed one of the first avowed advocates of the practice of total abstinence as early as was the well known and honored dr benjamin rush one of the signers of the declaration of independence and a firm believer in christian universalism he not only advocated this practice himself but was especially interested in commending it to the attention of two religious bodies in pennsylvania the episcopalians and presbyterians at their annual meetings when in later days the attention of the christian churches was called to the consideration of this reform no more zealous friends of it were found than those among universalists the universalist ministry was well represented and its services welcomed by others an instance is remembered of a deserved tribute given in his peculiar quaintness of speech by the elder dr lyman beecher to rev edwin thompson at an annual meeting of the massachusetts temperance society mr thompson was state agent for the society and had been very active in its work during the year so that a speaker alluded to him as having been in that time the main spoke in the wheel indeed said dr beecher it seems to me that he has been the hub and all the spokes and a considerable part of the rim the reform in our country was quickened by the washingtonian movement which involved the reformation of the inebriate and his work to redeem others from the destroyer although there were backsliders in this as in all reformatory movements yet the number of the saved justified a thousand times the interest taken in the great work itself it was an indication of what might be done everywhere and in all time by divine aid and human will at work relying upon it it seemed also to emphasize the truth that men however far overcome by wrong habit are not to be given over as irreclaimable it was in accord with the grand idea that there are no lost ones so far astray as to be beyond the mercy which sent him into the world who said i came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance they that are whole need not a physician but they that are sick legislation took higher and stronger ground in reference to the evil of intemperance the subject went into politics more than ever the doctrine of prohibition gained advocates a law favoring it was passed in massachusetts and afterwards in maine prosecutions and law suits followed and appeals went up to the highest courts to test the constitutionality of the law this was affirmed by them just as the framers of the law knew that it would be despite all sophisms and evasions the common sense of every man will settle down into the conviction that the people of a nation if they would be really strong and free must employ every safeguard against this giant evil that has so constantly outraged and cursed our world the rising of the women of the west in to suppress the demoralizing work of the liquor saloons was an outspoken providential protest against these scourges of our civilization jeered by the thoughtless and insulted and cursed by the dealers in the death poison it was an indication that made the traffickers in strong drink thoughtful the friends of woman to take new note of her righteous demands and of her reformatory power and every true soldier in the temperance army to put on new courage in view of the many instrumentalities which god is able to raise up in aid of his redeeming work with his children one result of the womanscrusade has been the formation of the womanschristian temperance unions in all parts of our land the signs of progress in this reform are more significant than ever the popularity of the prohibitory law in maine the prohibitory clause just put into the kansas and iowa constitutions and proposed in other states the numerous reform leagues the proposal to institute in our congress a thorough investigation in reference to the bearing of this question of liquor making and vending on the industrial social and political welfare of our nation the continued discussion of the effects of the use of intoxicants by leading statesmen scientists and medical professors of our age and the bringing out of new facts all showing the vital importance of the temperance reform and also the evident tendency of these movements as apprehended by the devotees of the liquor interests themselves moving them as at a recent convention of brewers in washington to avow their determination to defeat if possible by all practicable means the legal moral and especially the religious endeavors put forth against the evil by which they are enriched at the expense of the prosperity happiness and peace of so many millions of our land these facts are unmistakable indications of still greater achievements in the days and years to come like most reforms this one must work a long way on to its completion the evil against which it contends is deep seated and far reaching appetite avarice and the drinking usages of society are its strongholds but all these are not impervious to the inroads of the right upon them the public conscience is awake to the demands of this reform as it never was before when that is more truthfully and generally educated moral suasion will have freer course and restrictive laws will find a stronger support everywhere peace the history of our race is one of warfare wars and fightings have been realized among men from the beginning and the world has not outgrown the sanguinary strife even during the time of which we are speaking in these pages when so much has been done for the mental and moral enlightenment of mankind these murderous human contentions have been going on in the old world and the new our own nation has passed through one of the darkest passages of its history the war of the rebellion came of a war that existed previous to the withdrawal of the southern states of our union the war of slavery for slavery itself is war always an outrage on the rights of human beings perpetrated by members of a common brotherhood and thus one war opened the way to another they who were warring upon others could no longer bear to have their wrong doings questioned but claimed the right to multiply and perpetuate them so came secession so came the fratricidal contest the majority of the nation did not seek war did not desire it but the unionists of the nation deemed themselves justified in resisting the efforts of the secessionists to dismember the nation and so through a defensive warfare sought to preserve the union it was a terrible ordeal and although the abomination of slavery was swept away it was at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of a vast amount of treasure of suffering as yet unrevealed and of a lamentable demoralization the almighty brought out of it a new order of things with our nation by abolishing human bondage and placing freedom in the ascendancy the new order however is not yet fully effected it will take time wisdom patience mutual forbearance sympathy and fraternal help to secure this result but one reform aids another a higher view of the claims of human freedom will tend to effect a clearer perception of the great claims of the human brotherhood if man is too good to be enslaved by his fellow man he is too good to be destroyed by him if human freedom is sacred so is human life and we are sure that this grand conception has been very clearly realized and as clearly affirmed during the middle of the present century in the midst of the worldsconflicts during this time the advocates of peace principles on both sides of the atlantic have not been inactive they have had a hearing if a limited one in christendom peace associations have been more operative than before and the pulpit and press have made new appeals to the public for the promotion of peace principles excellent publications in essay sermon or oration have been issued from the press we hear of one sunday in when one hundred and twenty peace sermons were preached in the city of london our philanthropic countryman elihu burritt has done much for this cause one of the ablest and most admirable of appeals in behalf of peace on earth and good will to men was given in in boston by charles sumner who may be justly reckoned as one of the brightest lights among philanthropists and statesmen of the present century on the true grandeur of nations moved by the threatening aspect of affairs between the united states and mexico the orator denounced the war system as the ordeal by battle still unwisely continued by international law as the arbiter of justice between nations and insisted that this system ought to give way to peaceful arbitration for the settlement of international questions as the private ordeal of battle had given way to such substitutes in the administration of justice between individuals the oration attracted unusual attention led to much controversy and was widely circulated both in america and europe it was pronounced by richard cobden to be the most noble contribution made by any modern writer to the cause of peace the delusion that wars must always be expected more or less with mankind is a vagary of barbarism and not a true christian thought rather is the poet right when he says war is a game which were their subjects wise kings would not play at wars may be lessened may be outgrown in human society there are better ways of settling human disputes than by an appeal to arms facts in the history of our own nation prove it here are a few of them in the question of the northeastern boundary between the united states and the dependencies of great britain was settled by arbitration in the question of restitution or compensation for slaves found on board of british vessels during the war of the matter was referred to the emperor of russia and his award accepted by both nations in a difficulty between the united states and the government of chili and peru was referred to the arbitration of the king of the belgians and settled by his award in the claims of the united states and great britain to landed property in and about puget sound were adjusted by peaceable reference in the well known alabama claim which caused so much ill feeling between the united states and england and threatened to involve the two countries in a terrible war president grant referring to the settlement of this claim said in his message of dec this year has witnessed two great nations having one language and lineage settling by peaceful arbitration disputes of long standing which were liable at any time to bring nations to a bloody conflict the example thus set if successful in its final issue will be followed by other civilized nations and finally be the means of restoring to pursuits of industry millions of men now maintained to settle the disputes of nations by the sword is this good possible assuredly if good is able to prevail over evil right over wrong love over hatred and what does the christian gospel signify but this peace on earth and good will toward men this good will shall come if christians will do their duty by insisting on the practicability of it the undercurrent of a better feeling is gaining force as the great truth of the brotherhood of man is more deeply and extensively realized if the present toiling time is dark there is light beyond it the unerring prophecy of the time when nations shall learn war no more as said victor hugo at the congress of peace in paris in a day will come when the only battle field shall be the market open to commerce and the mind opening to new ideas when a cannon shall be exhibited in public museums just as an instrument of torture is now and people shall be astonished how such a thing could have been a day shall come when those two immense groups the united states of america and the united states of europe shall be seen placed in presence of each other extending the hand of fellowship across the ocean exchanging their produce their commerce their industry their arts their genius clearing the earth peopling the deserts meliorating creation under the eyes of the creator and uniting for the good of all these two irresistible and infinite powers the fraternity of men and the power of god in agreement with the foregoing statements in reference to the reform movements of our time we may note more briefly certain other indications of the increase of that spirit which would lessen the afflictions and wrongs and promote the well being of society the treatment of criminals has been a subject of much thought and discussion during the generation just passed it has been and still is an open question among the more thoughtful whether the subject of the proper treatment of criminals has been regarded aright we may justly plead for benevolent sympathy without being the apologist of crime conscience must be remembered as well as the cry of pitying tenderness and punishment must have a meaning or the distinctions of right and wrong are lost it will be a sad day as one has truly said when those who violate our laws are more pitied than blamed christians are bound by their religion to labor for the prevention of crime and for the strict application of all righteous laws to the criminal to impress as they can the awfulness of sin on their own and on othersconsciences and to recall the fallen back to virtue shamed by his sin and resolute and strong in the working of a regenerated will thus vindicating and imitating the goodness and severity of god the treatment of convicts in our prisons at the present time is generally more in accordance with these considerations than in the past when severity was deemed more needful as applied to criminals who were subjects of total depravity than a proportionate mercy which regarded them not only as lost ones but as capable of a possible restoration to their rightful owner and almighty friend the reform schools in our different states are working in this christian direction the subject of capital punishment has elicited much attention during the time of which we are speaking it has been discussed in newspapers pamphlets legislatures pulpits and lyceum halls some of our states have abolished the gallows others are agitating this subject in their legislatures the present governor long of massachusetts in his annual messages of the last two years has recommended the abolition of the death penalty a large number of ministers of the universalist church have constantly affirmed their opposition to it rev charles spear published a sensible work on the subject and rev hosea ballou thirty years since gave the whole question a very thorough investigation in reply to rev dr cheever of new york and others michigan was the first state in the union to abolish the death penalty and a late report makes the statement that with a population of no man has been executed in the state during the last thirty five years and that a less number of murders have been perpetrated during the last ten years in ratio to the population than during the same decade in any other state where public or even private executions have prevailed capital punishment has also been abolished in maine the position and work of woman has also been a subject of deep and widespread interest christianity has ever given to woman a place denied her by all other religions as christian thought has had freer course and christian theology and practical work new and brighter development the relations of woman to the welfare and progress of human society have been more clearly understood and appreciated her rights in law are now more plainly and justly defined and the importance of her equal education with the other sex admitted and emphasized she is prominent and indispensable as a teacher all over the land she is a graduate of the college and a professor there she is a successful practitioner in the legal and medical professions she is an ordained minister of the gospel she is a merchant a book keeper and accountant an editor an artist a mechanic a farmer and has more than average success in all these departments of activity her right to the ballot is slowly but surely coming to a settlement which it will take time and thought on her part for when she asks for the ballot it will be hers and enlightened legislation to effect where she has exercised this right none but favorable results have been witnessed our state legislatures are called upon to give attention to the subject and a committee of our national congress have just decided to report a proposed amendment to the constitution declaring that the right of citizens of the united states to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the united states or by any state on account of sex and giving congress the power by appropriate legislation to enforce the provisions of this article if congress will agree to propose this amendment and three fourths of the states will ratify it woman suffrage will be legalized other questions the philanthropic and successful efforts in behalf of the blind the deaf and dumb and feeble minded of fallen women and orphan children are becoming more and more apparent every year all in cheering accord with that restorative mercy and power evinced in him whose mission was to relieve the sorrows and remove the afflictive evils that beset mankind and no more unmistakable evidence of the decline of that horrible doctrine of endless suffering for the wicked can be realized than the instituting and maintaining societies for the suppression of cruelty to animals surely the father of our spirits will not be less merciful towards any of his children than these children are justly called upon to be to the inferior creatures of

paul phil iv the universalist church is much indebted to its faithful women taking into consideration its comparative numbers no other church in america has been more signally favored in the genial and healthful influence of its writers who have borne the honorable name of woman they have been instrumental in spreading the doctrines of the primitive gospel and the moral bearings of their religion before the world in most attractive and impressive forms and have disabused the public in its wrong estimate of the character and ability of the advocates of universalism and the tendency and influence of its principles among those worthy to be remembered in this goodly company who have passed from the present life during the last half century we may mention the gifted sister poets alice and phbe cary mrs sarah broughton mrs julia scott mrs sarah mayo mrs charlotte a jerauld mrs henrietta a bingham mrs elmina waldo mrs luella case and mrs cobb among the living we may note the names of mrs catharine sawyer whose contributions to our church journals are so well known mrs mary a livermore who in her past connection with our church work and literature has gained such a high reputation with her voice and pen as well as in her deeds of benevolence and mercy during the war of the rebellion mrs julia a carney whose hymns and instruction books have made her name so familiar in our sunday schools and homes mrs caroline a soule whose consecrated words and works have secured her a name which the church of her love will hold in righteous estimation mrs nancy munroe mrs lathrop formerly mrs bacon mrs bruce mrs patterson mrs s perkins mrs a hanaford miss carnahan miss remick miss minnie s davis but it is difficult to know where to draw the line in this counting others might be named would space permit who have made their contributions to the literature of the church the older and well known retain their wonted fires and the new and younger are coming to succeed and honor them some of our women are speaking our best and most practical words in our churches prayer and conference and missionary meetings in our sunday schools conventions and associations in our pulpits as evangelists and pastors in our educational institutions if the universalist church has not at this hour as brilliant a presentation of christian literature from the pen of its women as it had thirty years since there never was more of the practical and available talent of woman in it than at the present time never so much organized effort on their part as now this effort seems to have taken new form and life since the centenary year of the church came round previous to that date the history of many a new movement many a new parish or church had been the history of womansfidelity in the inception progress and success of the enterprise it was but natural then that in the inspiration awakened by the approach of this centennial year the women of the church should be aroused to new and still greater effort and thus it was that the womanscentenary aid association was organized at buffalo in september the organization was effected and the main work under it was to aid in the raising of the proposed murray fund of the total amount raised by that association for this object in all the states and elsewhere deducting comparatively moderate expenses and placed in the treasury of the united states convention for the murray fund was nearly women thus became members of the association the fact was a new and cheering manifestation the christian leader a universalist journal of new york city thus alluded to it if our women need no eulogy we need the satisfaction of making a warm explicit confession of our admiration of their attempt and our gratitude for what they have done they can well afford to dispense with the acknowledgment but we cannot afford not to make it it becomes us here to raise no question as to womansfitness for certain employments and political prerogatives hitherto the prerogatives of the rougher sex but should we reach what some call extreme views on the several points and should our zeal bring us onto the platform as a champion thereof the sledgehammer we should wield is the work of the universalist women in their centenary year god bless and make us grateful for our women since that time the association has taken the title of the womans centenary association dropping the word aid used in the beginning in reference to its work in connection with the united states convention it has much other work of its own now its tract publishing and circulation its scotland mission its endowment of women professorships in one of our colleges its special gifts for the aid of theological students the helping of needy and worthy parish organizations establishing sunday schools in waste places and assisting to sustain them and other beneficent works are included in its ministries every yearsreport of its doings has spoken to the public of the utility and effectiveness of its work in may mrs caroline a soule the first president of the association sailed from new york city for scotland on a mission of observation as a company of believers there had for some time received aid and encouragement from the association she passed several months in scotland preaching in dunfermline glasgow larbert dundee and other places and organized the scottish universalist convention she also assisted at the dedication of a little church in stenhousemuir the only universalist church edifice in great britain three years afterwards she went by approval of the association as a preacher and missionary after preaching awhile in dundee and glasgow in she organized in the last named place the st paul universalist church and established a sunday school and church library great numbers of tracts and many books twenty barrels of closely packed matter were circulated as helps in her work the rite of ordination was conferred upon her by the scottish convention during her work in scotland she has proved by her fidelity self sacrifice and persistence in her work during many and severe discouragements her qualifications for a christian missionary worthy to be recorded among the most devoted of any in the other churches who have been strengthened and honored by the accomplishment of devoted women in their missionary fields her work is a noble beginning of that which may continue to be done by the universalist church if it shall possess a zeal commensurate with the magnitude of that pre eminent gospel to be preached to every creature which it is called of god to maintain christian universalism and woman what god hath joined together let not man put asunder for a more ample view of the position and work of the women of the universalist church we refer the reader to the volume recently given to the public by mrs hanson entitled our women workers chicago chapter sketches of ministers insignificant as the denomination of universalists may now appear in the eyes of the world it is not to be doubted that the time is coming when it will occupy in this country and throughout all christendom a much more commanding position and men will ask for the beginning of what they shall then see and love to read the story of our present struggles and victories rev sawyer it is within the first century of our national republic just passed that this great faith in the universality of godslove and of the work of christian salvation with man has gained a prominence in the churches which it had not known since the earlier times of christianity it is of the last half century in connection with the history of this faith however that i would more particularly speak as it is within this period that the work of its promulgation in our own country has been especially realized its public advocates multiplied and their ministries extended in many of the states of our union its publications and other educational forces have increased and as we have seen it has identified itself with some of the most significant reforms of the age many of its friends and representatives have been among the worthy and excellent of the times in which they have lived and not a few of its public advocates deserve to be honorably and thankfully remembered in the present and the future for the contributions they have made to the progress of the church in the knowledge of christian truth and the realization and enjoyment of the christian life it is one of the enjoyments connected with the preparation of these pages that the writer may call them up in memory and speak of them as they appear to him and note some of their characteristics and pay them that tribute of respect and honor which they so justly merit though others may appear as their successors in the same high calling they can scarcely be more faithful or effective in their labors than have these earnest defenders of the abrahamic faith who have been foremost in its promulgation during the past generation if many of them now rest from their labors their works surely follow them and their names deserve tender and thankful remembrance by their survivors in the church for whose prosperity and honor they so hopefully bravely and faithfully taught and wrought it should be understood that in the succeeding sketches of ministers it is not the intent of the writer to present anything like a full record of all who have faithfully served in this capacity in our country during the time of our church history comprehended in these pages a complete biographical encyclopædia cannot be compassed in so limited a space it is from his own particular standpoint of observation and recollection that the writer presents his testimony furthermore it is mainly to those now departed that these references are made the ballous have been conspicuous in this conflict of religious opinions during the present century foremost among the family of preachers most of whom have departed stands acknowledged hosea the elder one of the strongest theologians of the past or present in new england he lived through half the present century being nearly thirty years old when he entered it and was vigorous to the last at the age of eighty one the statement of his life history is not a new one now the four ample volumes containing it by dr whittemore have been extensively read and will be for years to come but having known and revered him it is an unspeakable pleasure to the writer to state his impressions of the man and the preacher hosea ballou a native of richmond came from the home of a worthy baptist clergyman whose means of living and supporting a large family were small he had but meagre opportunities for education but employed what he had to the best advantage and became a school teacher in early manhood he joined the baptist church when quite young but afterwards grew out of its theology and became convinced of the truth of universalism discouraged in his first attempts as a public speaker he grew more confident and soon attracted much attention wherever he appeared as an advocate of his faith his pastorates were in barnard vt portsmouth salem and boston mass he died in the last named city june after a pastorate of more than thirty years his two sons hosea of vermont and massena of stoughton mass have served in the ministry many years mr ballou was gifted with great logical clearness aptness and force his preaching was plain scriptural and often fervent and no one could bring home to the hearer the great themes of the divine fatherhood and human brotherhood more effectively than he wakeful indeed must be the theological opponent who could evade the force of his logic he employed the socratic method by drawing the objector out so that his own statements would confound or confute him many valiant ones of the opposite faith were there who could readily assail and denounce his doctrines where his replies could not reach them but who would be very sure to keep at a respectful distance from that sword of the spirit which he wielded with such consummate skill of the published works of mr ballou none have evinced more mental clearness and vigor than his volume on atonement issued in its plainness and adaptedness to the common reader its sharp logic and above all its apt and convincing appeals to the scriptures render it a timely helper everywhere and always in the discussion of the theologies which have assumed the christian name and which are now being so closely scrutinized every reader and student of theology understands something of the old theory of atonement so long dominant in the christian church so exceedingly perplexing to honest and independent inquirers so hard to be vindicated by its ablest advocates and so surely sowing the seeds of scepticism and infidelity in many minds volume after volume has appeared in defence and attempted illustration of it sin an infinite evil being a violation of infinite law and therefore the law requiring an infinite sacrifice short of which no atonement could be made the transgression of adam bringing the whole human race into the same situation of sin and misery and subjecting them all to the infinite penalty of an infinite law which they had violated in their parent before they individually existed in view of this penalty which was endless suffering god himself to placate his own wrath against the delinquents assumed a body of flesh and blood and suffered the penalty of the law by death not that god himself actually died but the human body in which he came this is deemed the infinite sacrifice by which it is possible for a part of mankind to be saved divines of the greatest ability writes mr ballou and of the first rank among the literati have drained the last faculty of invention in plodding through the dark region of metaphysics to bring up a samuel to explain the solecism of satisfying an infinite dissatisfaction now let us note how the author of atonement quietly sets forth this absurdity it is all comprehended in a single page of the volume we will state it as it is often stated by those who believe it which is by the likeness of debt and credit the sinner owed a debt to divine justice which he was unable to discharge the divine being cannot consistently with his honor dispense with the pay but says i must have what is my just due but as the debtor has not ability to pay the smallest fraction divine wisdom lays a deep concerted mysterious plan for the debt to be discharged and how was it why for god to pay it himself our neighbor owes us a hundred pounds time of payment comes and we make a demand for our dues says our neighbor my misfortunes have been such that i am not the possessor of the smallest fraction of property in the world and as much as i owe you i am worse than nothing i declare to him positively that i will not lose so much as a fraction of the interest and leave him a friend calls and asks me how i succeeded in obtaining my dues of my neighbor i reply my neighbor is not nor will he ever be able to pay me any part of my demand my friend says he is sorry that i should lose my debt i answer i shall not lose it i have very fortunately in my meditations on the subject thought of a method by which i can avail myself of the whole to my full satisfaction and i think it is a method which no person in the world but myself could ever have discovered my friend is curious and impatient to know the secret never before found out the reader may guess his confusion on my telling him that as i have that sum already by me i am now going to pay up the obligation before the interest is any larger this has been called the gospel plan which contains the depths of infinite wisdom what could be plainer and how could the justness of this representation be questioned questioned it was of course not by any attempt at elaborate examination and refutation but by a sermon now and then given out from some orthodox pulpit by some honest minister entrenched behind the prejudices of his hearers and altogether disinclined to meet the whole question in the broadest daylight of investigation out of this plain exposition and others like it since made have come the examinations and statements and restatements and amendments and improvements of the orthodox doctrine of atonement which are keeping astir at this hour the pulpits and schools of theology all over the land and across the seas many are the anecdotes of mr ballou given in the biographies already before the public were we to attempt a selection we should be at a loss where to begin we have one in mind given us by rev moses ballou which we have never seen in our religious journals a mr buckman a relative of mr ballou had taken it upon him as a matter of conscience with very little mental preparation to be a preacher he had a good deal of self assurance and withal strong love of approbation being in company with mr ballou at one time he was anxious to get an approving word from him and said brother ballou i am awfully tried with myself ah said mr ballou why so what is the trouble why said mr buckman it is this to think that i should ever try to preach and know so little now what do you think about it why said mr ballou hesitating a little if you really want to know my mind i think that if you knew a little more you would never try again how welcome was he at the great meetings of the church conferences associations conventions he was usually called upon to give the discourse at the close of the meeting and it was often a feast to hear him as he would dwell upon the excellency of the divine attributes the exceeding great and precious promises and the plain and reasonable precepts of the gospel a prophetic word of good cheer would be spoken by him at such times he would see and make others see the clouds receding and the clear day opening in the blue and golden sky beyond however acceptably others had preached before him the expectation was that somehow his discoursing would give finish and sanction to them all and it was so at barre vt where the general convention met in excellent discourses were delivered by able ministers present and so rich and varied were the topics dwelt upon that the query was somewhat humorously proposed what will father ballou have to say after all this judge of our interest and delight when the modest man arose and in the most quiet way proposed for his text the words of elihu in job xxxvi suffer me a little and i will show thee that i have yet to speak on godsbehalf and such a vindication of the character of the gracious father of all in face of the aspersions cast upon it by his weak and erring children it was simply electrifying the late rev theodore clapp of new orleans and a minister in the unitarian church once related that being present in a gathering of unitarian clergymen in boston the conversation turned on the changes which had been effected in the theology of new england and the question who of all her great divines had wrought the most and greatest changes of course channing had the most advocates but there were some who named edwards emmons hopkins and other doctors of the orthodox schools at last dr clapp who had remained silent was appealed to gentlemen said he you have not yet named the man what replied all in astonishment not named him no gentlemen you have not yet named him why who can it be we have named every preacher of eminence in new england and yet gentlemen you have not named the man well who do you say he is with great impressiveness mr clapp uttered the name hosea ballou has effected more and greater changes in the theological opinions of the people of new england than any man dead or living there was silence for a time and the discussion was not renewed mr ballou was a vigorous writer his treatise on the atonement notes on the parables and volumes of sermons are among his best offerings to the public the first named book ought to be read throughout christendom he was through his professional life a welcome contributor to the periodicals of the church he has stood and will continue to stand high his imposing statue at mount auburn will look out upon generations mentally and spiritually blest through his truthful ministries the eldest son of mr ballou rev hosea faxon ballou was born in dana mass april and died in wilmington vt may at the age of thirty he became desirous of entering the ministry but hesitated from anxiety as to the support of his growing family he began the study of theology however and in after a few months with rev benjamin whittemore preached with success three times in the vicinity of boston and was called to whitingham vt he was ordained at boston june after a pastorate of nearly twenty five years at whitingham he went to wilmington where he was pastor until in the infirmities of age led him to abandon the pulpit after a ministry of forty years without the loss of a single sunday in person mr ballou was tall erect and strong bearing a marked resemblance to his distinguished father in face and form as well as in mental characteristics his sermons evinced a high order of intellect and cultivation during the last seventeen years of his residence in whitingham he held the office of town clerk and in wilmington was twice elected to the constitutional convention and once to the state legislature he was president of the wilmington savings bank for seven years before his death and occupied many other positions of honor and trust he reared a large family of children and it has been said of him in truth we may believe that during the past fifty years no man in southern vermont exerted so wide an influence over religious opinions another son of mr ballou massena ballou was pastor of the universalist church in stoughton mass for twenty five years and now resides in that town at an advanced age an elder brother of hosea was rev daballou of munroe mass a man of remarkable acuteness as a reasoner and quite as sound a theologian as the more distinguished one just noticed but whose success as a preacher was much less because of the want of that ease and fluency in the delivery of his discourses which his brother possessed but those who knew him well have borne witness to the excellence of his character and his great ability as an expounder of the word of the gospel his son rev moses ballou held a prominent place in our church as one of its talented ministers and as a writer of more than ordinary ability he was born in munroe mass march educated at the academy at brattleboro vt he began preaching at the age of twenty two one of his earliest charges was at bath he was subsequently settled at portsmouth where he had pastorates twice he had charge of the churches at bridgeport hartford and new haven conn and in later years removed to new york city where he was pastor of the bleecker street church he then came to philadelphia and took charge of the church of the restoration failing in health he gave up his work in that city and removed to atco his friends there erected for him a small church edifice where he held service when able so to do he died in philadelphia may he was the author of two books one the memorial of rev merritt sanford the other the divine character vindicated a review of rev edward beecherswork entitled the conflict of ages this last named volume indicates the masterly mental strength of the man dr beecher himself we are informed acknowledged it to have been the ablest of any reply made to his work it has never yet been read by universalists as it deserves to be mr ballou was not only a strong and logical writer but an earnest and eloquent preacher dr thayer writes of him in his best days when in the vigor of his manhood physically and mentally few men could hold a thoughtful and intellectual audience to closer attention than he and even those who differed from him theologically acknowledged the ability with which he maintained his positions and were little disposed to enter the lists of controversial argument against them and at times when the great truths of the gospel seemed in the midst of his speaking to dawn upon him in new and larger revelation he would break into speech that thrilled his hearers and lifted them for a space into the fellowship of the angels he knew for a good while that the end was approaching and he was ready death was to him only the door that opened into the new immortal life which was almost as presently real to him as the life he was living here and when at the last his life long friend rev james shrigley said good bye to him he exclaimed why say good bye when we shall meet again to morrow illustration ballou d from a dag smith sc daniels pr of all the worthies in this company of church leaders of which we are speaking not one of them is entitled to a higher place than hosea ballou or d as he was called before the doctorate was conferred upon him a rare man was he a clear headed and closely logical thinker an untiring student one of the soundest of preachers and humblest and noblest of men we have no fear of using language too strong in our statement of his character its pre eminence and worth an editor of a volume of his discourses has given it on the title page from laman blanchard his thoughts were as a pyramid up piled on whose far top an angel sat and smiled yet in his heart was he a simple child he was of guilford vt born there in his parents were baptists but the thoughtful and studious boy before the age of nineteen had embraced universalism he began early the study of latin and greek and gave much attention in later days to ecclesiastical history he was pastor in stafford conn and in roxbury and medford mass he was for some years one of the editors of the universalist magazine and afterwards of the quarterly a publication which under his supervision was a most creditable addition to the literature of the christian church his most valuable contribution to this literature is his ancient history of universalism the result of long and patient research in a new field of inquiry and which proved to be a work of acknowledged merit it settled at once and for all time the loose statement that universalism was a new doctrine not known to any extent in olden times some of the brightest lights in the christian church are recognized as its early advocates harvard university of which he was for some years a trustee conferred upon him its honorary degree of and tufts college for which he had anxiously pleaded and diligently labored elected him her first president his scholarship writes another was not only general and varied but exact in details and frequently astonishing by its minute acquaintance with things and events out of the ordinary channels of information and his knowledge was so unostentatiously held and kindly and modestly imparted that it required special inquiry to elicit it and seemed but natural to him his gentle manners and readiness to impart information and his mild and loving spirit won for him the esteem of all who became acquainted with him so that their admiration of the scholar and teacher were often lost in their affection for the friend two brothers of dr ballou le and william s were for years preachers and pastors in new england william resided in the west for a time where he died in levi was pastor of the universalist church in north orange mass for nineteen years clear minded gentle and yet forcible men were they making good proof of their ministry rev edward turner was for years one of the ablest ministers in the universalist church he was born in medfield mass july and was in early life sent to the school of the celebrated hannah adams and her sister in his family removed to sturbridge mass and in his seventeenth year he was at leicester academy he was educated under orthodox influence and used to say that he held the minister in such fearful reverence that he would jump over the wall to hide himself if he saw that he must meet him on the road the towns in the section of worcester county in which he lived were among those where universalism was first preached oxford especially was one of its strongholds the first convention having met there when he was ten years old in such a neighborhood he could not have lived long without hearing something of the strange doctrine but all that is known is that he is said to have been a universalist as early as his sixteenth or seventeenth year he began to preach in when at the age of twenty two he preached his first sermon at bennington vt he first appears in the public records of the universalists in when it is stated that a letter of license was given him by the general convention from this time until his name appears in the records nearly every year he is mentioned in the records of the convention for as of sturbridge and also of charlton from which it is inferred that both these towns had societies of which he was pastor in he removed to salem mass here he remained till june when he accepted a call to charlestown mass in march he accepted an invitation to portsmouth where he continued till the spring of he was afterwards minister in charlton his old home and at fishkill landing in he removed to jamaica plain to a home left by a son in law where he passed the remainder of his days he was twice married he occasionally preached up to the last he was present as one of the bearers at the funeral of his old friend and co worker mr ballou june and departed this life jan with the opinions of the elder ballou in regard to future or no future punishment he had no sympathy and an estrangement somehow grew up which led him to connect himself later in life with the unitarians instead of remaining with those in the universalist ministry such as ballou d the streeters and skinners rev willis thomas king and others whose opinions coincided with his own a severe illness in wrought a marked change in him before this he was quite robust and erect afterwards he appeared more feeble previous to this sickness like mr ballou he had been exclusively an extemporaneous preacher and is said to have been one of the rousing sort live vehement electric but from this period his whole manner changed and his ordinary preaching became subdued languid what is called moderate at times perhaps even heavy dr brooks in an excellent biographical notice of him says he had immense latent power at times when kindled by some great occasion or stirred by opposition or some peculiar circumstance this came out then he preached with all his old fire and sometimes rose into impassioned and commanding eloquence all the fountains of the great deep within him were broken up and thought and feeling came in a flood rev russell streeter writes me on convention occasions he was on the whole second to no one my parents tell me that he was smetimes very animated they speak particularly of one sermon in portsmouth called forth by some bitter outbreak of opposition when he preached with surpassing effect others report similar instances doctrinal sermons in abundance he preached but even those most argumentative and most sharply controversial were flavored with a religious meaning and reasoned to practical ends he never preached a sermon that was merely doctrinal but always made dogmatic discussion subordinate to moral impression though in a mistaken estimate of duty as we believe he separated from us his name can never be taken out of our records as one of the worthiest of our early heroes nor his work cease to be an occasion of gratitude and honorable pride to us nor his reverent and saintly character fail to be one of the most precious portions of our denominational inheritance the streeter brothers are to be numbered in this company of the preachers sebastian was for more than thirty years pastor of the first universalist church on hanover street boston he was a minister of marked character light framed nervous dark eyed of quick movement clear and strong minded voluble in speech affable at home everywhere especially in the pulpit under many disadvantages he laid for himself the foundation of a professional education he intended to qualify himself for the law but a superior wisdom and will called him to the christian pulpit at the age of eighteen while a school teacher in new hampshire he was a talented advocate of christian universalism at twenty two he preached his first discourse he travelled extensively as a missionary in maine encountering the reproach which awaited the advocacy of his faith in those days in many parts of new england and having the honor of being stoned once while preaching in a christian house of worship and by a zealous member of a church with him however opposition was an incentive to new earnestness in his work he was singularly gifted as a preacher he despised all garishness and affectation and was usually full of his theme there was in him a latent fire of eloquence which when kindled stirred his audience to the depths of their souls the writer calls to mind occasions of his preaching one while the hearer was standing in the doorway of a church at a meeting of the general convention in vermont the pulpit was between the doors that opened upon the faces of the congregation the preacher was in the heat of his discoursing on the words of jesus and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me there were no indifferent listeners and but few dry eyes to be seen the remembrance has often been an inspiration the other was at the session of the rockingham association in nottingham in mr streeter delivered the occasional discourse an able and a timely one he was speaking of reforms and reformers and was all aglow with his theme he thus came to a climax we know of a revivalist and reformer infinitely superior in skill and power to those of all sects combined one who will continue to move onward conquering and to conquer till he has renewed a right spirit in every heart till he has reformed fully and forever the countless millions of our race yes blessed be god we know his name it is jesus of nazareth the lion of the tribe of judah the son of god the saviour of the world amen from a brother minister the preacher responded hallelujah glory to god in the highest jesus will make all things new let heaven proclaim his honor let earth echo and re echo his praises and let eternity respond them through the long and lofty roll of its interminable ages said mr streeter to a friend one monday morning i had something tender to put into my sermon yesterday morning as i was going to church a poor woman came to me to borrow a dollar to get bread for her children and as i handed it to her she offered me a small locket containing a braid of hair from the head of a little child she had buried a week ago take back the locket said i it is too sacred for my hands but keep the dollar you are welcome to that it does me more good to give it than you to receive it and you can have more if you need then she wept and said she was a poor widow living in such a street near by and her poor children had not had a mouthful since yesterday noon and she had nothing to buy them bread i knew by her looks that she told me the truth but to satisfy her i went and saw where she lived and saw her children and gave her more money and told her i would look to her wants again to morrow then i went into the pulpit and put the incident into a sermon and i have not preached so well nor enjoyed the service so much for many a day his heart was often overflowing with such charities as this through all his ministry he was the life of a conference meeting and his friday evening conferences in the hanover street vestry were never forgotten by those who attended them as a pastor he was always welcomed in the homes of his parishioners sharing as he did their joys and sorrows with the sympathy of a brother and friend as an officiating attendant at weddings he was exceedingly popular and his yearly marriage list for a long time exceeded in numbers that of any other clergyman in boston on funeral occasions he was eminently a son of consolation there was such an unction in his usual manner of preaching a manner so peculiarly adapted to the services of the sabbath that a brother minister who highly respected him quaintly suggested that sabbathstrain rather than sebastian might properly be used as his name as another has written of him he was an intensely magnetic man it was not simply what he said but the spiritual unction with which he uttered the truth that won and held you mr streeter lived to the age of eighty four in his last days he suffered intensely from asthma which had long afflicted him he has left the example of a true and noble life to the churches rev russell streeter was a younger brother of sebastian and a man of much mental vigor sharp witty and logical he had quite a number of ministerial settlements in new england and in them all was noted for his ability as a preacher for his peculiarities of character and his good qualities as a neighbor and citizen he was the first editor of the christian intelligencer a universalist weekly paper published at portland me was minister in that city for some years and afterwards much later in life went to pay the society a long pastorate visit of six and a half years which proved very agreeable to pastor and people he died at woodstock vt feb mr streeter was a subject of impulses when in the happy mood no one it seemed to us could preach a more acceptable sermon than he when not in this favorable frame of mind he would not always do justice to himself we can never forget a discourse the closing one at a conference in orford from the text behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity the sermons previously delivered were timely and had been well received and he was fully in the spirit of them all and felt that he had the strong sympathies of his hearers his words dropped like the rain and distilled as the dew doctrine illustration exhortation application all were excellent and there was an unction in the whole discourse that left upon the audience impressions most highly favorable to the faith he was setting forth on another occasion at the closing of a session of the new hampshire convention at lebanon he was the last preacher of the occasion very able and impressive discourses had been delivered by five other ministers mr streeter in an apparently extemporaneous effort took special notice of the matter and manner of them all and of the characters of the speakers and when he alluded to the sermon of the young and beloved hanscom as an eloquent appeal from one whose hollow and sepulchral tones seemed to indicate that the youthful and faithful speaker was nearing the tomb the effect was exceedingly impressive during the editorial career of mr streeter with the christian intelligencer he proved himself an able and effective writer and did much to call attention to the religious principles which he advocated while in portland he was neighbor to dr edward payson of distinguished memory in the congregational churches a very zealous advocate of christianity as he understood it and who regarded the gospel as promulgated by mr streeter as a pernicious and deadly heresy mr streeter was somewhat fond of looking after him and noting what he considered to be some of his errors in doctrine one evening the two happened to greet each other at a meeting where dr payson presided and which mr streeter attended soon theological questioning and cross questioning took place and some very strong denunciatory words were used by the doctor who was evidently much excited mr streeter was cool and keen in his replies and soon pushed the doctor into a very close corner causing him to contradict himself and to appear to his friends and all present to great disadvantage it was a triumph of temper as well as of theological ability the doctor saintly man as he surely was evidently felt the force of his neighborsreplies to him mr streeter was an able writer his familiar conversations have been much read they were adapted to the time in which they were written and so were some of his works on the revival movements of the orthodox churches in new england and elsewhere thirty or forty years ago his little volume entitled the latest news from three worlds heaven earth and hell was a scorching satire upon the extravagances connected with these movements scriptural argument and strong logic are mixed with keenest wit mirthfulness tenderness and rhetoric most glowing and redundant the ministers and churches to whom these reviews were addressed must have seen themselves in no very commendable light in that glass those who have once read the book attentively are not likely to forget it while engaged in the burchard war in vermont he published a pamphlet entitled mirror of calvinistic fanaticism or jedediah burchard co during a protracted meeting of twenty six days in woodstock vt it was an effective issue during most of his ministry mr streeter was a zealous and successful advocate of the temperance reform his addresses were always lively and interesting full of anecdote ludicrous hits and quaint sayings he was popular in all places and with all sects in this work and many who would hardly consent to hear him advocate his religious sentiments realized much enjoyment in listening to his defence of temperance principles on one occasion he was in the pulpit with a clergyman whose sense of self dignity was above the ordinary and who evidently had no strong inclination to be the subject of a joke while mr streeter was addressing the meeting he took occasion to describe the different mixtures of strong drink which were in use almost everywhere previous to the temperance reformation the last article of all said he added to perfect the dram was was really strange to say but i have just now lost the name will some one please to mention it nutmeg exclaimed the dignified clergyman near him thatsit responded mr streeter heswell informed in these matters i will warrant you we have heard an account of his attendance in western new york at a meeting where a methodist and a universalist were to preach in the same meeting house one sunday the universalist was to speak in the morning and the methodist in the afternoon in the last sermon the preacher was very severe in his treatment of universalists and their doctrine mr streeter seeing that there would be no opportunity for a rejoinder to his statements asked his ministering brother the privilege of taking his place in offering the closing prayer in which in the most reverential solemn and emphatic manner he briefly noted what he considered the misrepresentations of the last speaker and left upon the audience an impression decidedly favorable to his own faith the whole exercise quaint as it was was so remarkably able and timely that all criticism of it seemed to be silenced rev thomas jones was a successor of rev john murray at gloucester mass he came from the methodists in england and once belonged to the lady huntington connection he was a veritable welshman honest kind hearted blunt in speech and unique in his method and style of sermonizing his discourses were most positive statements of universalism and abounded in scriptural quotations some one wittily said of father balfour that so great was his reliance on the authority of the bible that he would go to it to find out whether a suspected bank note were counterfeit or not a parishioner of father jones remarked of him that he could hardly get through saying grace even at a fourth of july festival without repeating the passage for as in adam all die even so in christ shall all be made alive he had a long settlement in gloucester and died there at a ripe old age eighty three aug the discourse at the funeral was delivered by rev a mayo the officiating minister and pastor at the time he paid a just tribute to the honored old christian soldier and to the early defenders of our faith in america rev paul dean received fellowship as a universalist minister in he afterwards preached extensively in vermont and new hampshire and moved to whitestown in he traversed frequently large portions of central and western new york and held several successful discussions two particularly with rev mr lacy then a methodist afterwards an episcopalian bishop he removed to boston in and in his friends left the first church and built for him the church in bulfinch street now unitarian about he withdrew from the fellowship of the universalists and with a few others formed the massachusetts restorationist association on its decline he left boston and settled in framingham in he was an eloquent and popular preacher and was for many years an active freemason holding during the greater part of his manhood the highest offices of that order in the united states he died in framingham of paralysis oct aged seventy seven years in his early ministry mr dean while in central new york was subject to the oppositions which others of his fraternity sometimes encountered on one occasion an over zealous woman was so highly incensed at the expectation of his coming to the house where she resided that she had in preparation a kettle of hot water with which to greet him but was prevented by others from effecting her evil design an honest and clear minded man was rev walter balfour who came from his native scotland to charlestown mass he was first a congregationalist and afterwards a baptist and an acceptable preacher with both sects a greek and hebrew scholar and well instructed in sacred literature a most conscientious believer was he in the old theology of scottish orthodoxy he had never dreamed that universalism could be true but he was a reader and thinker and especially inclined to the good use of his logical powers he read the works of american orthodox authors among whom was professor stuart of andover for whose opinions he had profound respect the professor became engaged in a controversy with the eminent unitarian dr channing and mr balfour followed up the discussion with deep interest in his attempts to set forth christ as equal with god the professor cited the words of the revelator rev where things in heaven in earth and under the earth a periphrasis for the universe are said to bow the knee to jesus and ascribe blessing honor glory and power to him if this be not spiritual worship says the professor and if christ be not the object of it here i am unable to produce a case where worship can be called spiritual and divine mr balfour read and pondered he had not doubted the trinity the equality of christ with the father but what is the import of this statement that the universe is offering spiritual worship to christ is this the professorsmeaning would he thus avow the truth of universalism he becomes anxious on the subject addresses a respectful but earnest letter to the andover teacher asking an explanation of this statement awaits patiently an answer but none comes writes again and again still receiving no reply after nearly a year and a half his last appeal is made an equivocal answer came expressing unwillingness to reply to anonymous newspaper writers frivolous pretension and in discreditable contrast with the honesty and sincerity of the inquirer bound to oppose universalism as the creed of the institution compelled him to why would not the professor seek to save this inquirer from its fatal enticements but the professorsneglect was the inquirersopportunity he continued his inquiries and the result was his conversion to the universalist faith his life interest in it afterwards and the writing of volumes in its defence which aided in disseminating a knowledge of it widely throughout the land thus andover inadvertently through the unwillingness of this its teacher to save the honest inquirer from error gave to the universalist church one of its ablest most devoted and worthy ministers and defenders that is a part of its history henceforth a minister of marked character and of much service to the universalist church was rev john bisbe he was a massachusetts man and graduated at brown university in he was a student of law for a short time in taunton and while employed as a teacher in new hampshire became acquainted with universalism and subsequently a preacher of it his reading was extensive and his knowledge of the english language quite thorough in ordinary conversation he expressed himself with a striking precision he preached first in connecticut and western massachusetts and was settled in hartford conn from to when he became pastor of the universalist church in portland me he was an impressive preacher with no attempt at the sensational his personal appearance was notable a thin man of stiff perpendicular carriage and measured walk with light hair pale face and very dark eyes almost a glittering black the distinguished literary author john neal said of him i have heard mr bisbe repeatedly and the more i hear him the better i like him he is fervid free and powerful uses lofty and generous language and where he fails to reason it would appear to be not so much from a want of metaphysical power as from a habit of disregarding it from his appearance you would not expect much but notwithstanding this he is decidedly the most eloquent preacher in our part of the country he is moreover a man of exceedingly happy erudition the editor of the eastern argus wrote of him as a distinguished and talented preacher of transcendent powers of mind and eloquence in the pulpit eloquence that moved and burned as he breathed it and that sunk deep into the heart through the understanding as well as the passions of his audience he took especial interest in the church institution in the bible class for scriptural exposition and in all that pertained to personal religious culture and the work of christian charity he died march aged thirty six the death scene was indicative of the strength and joy of his faith soon after rev thomas king came to portsmouth he became acquainted with mr bisbe he had a high admiration of the talents and worth of the man before they met previous to the introduction mr king had been told of the stiffness and precision of mr bisbe in his salutations of others and was humorously inclined to use a little of the same precision in their first greeting the effect to an observer was amusing in the extreme but both parties preserved their dignity illustration thos whittemore smith among the foremost of the advocates of this old and new gospel in new england we may justly name the sturdy and indefatigable thomas whittemore he began earthly life with the present century jan he came up from lifeshumblest walks his parents educated him religiously in moderate calvinistic sentiments but he grew out of them and became sceptical until his attention was arrested and his mind deeply impressed by the preaching of rev hosea ballou in boston an acquaintance with mr ballou turned his attention to the ministry and he became a diligent student in preparation for that calling his first sermon written upon the bench at intervals between his working hours was preached in roxbury his dress for the occasion providentially coming in to him as he was too poor to obtain it himself his first pastorate was in milford his second and longer one in cambridgeport mass in which place he had his home until his death his work as editor of the trumpet was a long and vigorous one and the volumes that came from his pen beside this weekly periodical were of much value to the christian church historical exegetical musical were they all for the good of the christian cause in whose interest it was his delight to work he was a proud banner bearer of his church universalism was to him the alpha and omega of theology and religion he saw nothing that could take its place and held no fellowship with those who were disposed to compromise its claims his editorial pen was alive with clear scriptural expositions watchful warnings against the religious errors of the times and bold and defiant defences of what he accepted as christian truth his modern history of universalism is a book of rare merit and his commentary on the apocalypse one of the plainest and most sensible ever given to the public and one which theological critics of the dominant sects have been wary enough to let alone his four volumes of the life and writings of rev hosea ballou make out a valuable epitome of the history of universalism in massachusetts and in other parts of new england from the beginning to the middle of the century he had ready wit a never failing flow of spirits and a genial temperament which drew to him hosts of friends his preaching was always popular with the masses scriptural logical often strikingly illustrated if occasionally in a homely way fervent and telling with his congregations he was a welcome evangelist all over new england he was a man of rare business qualifications also he rendered much civic service to the state as legislator and was highly efficient as president and director of bank and railroad corporations he was stricken with paralysis more than a year before his decease and never regained his vigor he departed this life in in his sixty second year mr whittemore is remembered as a controversialist and with those who beheld him chiefly in this light his other qualities may not have been fairly estimated his very position as a christian theologian was aggressive he came into the field to face what he deemed religious error and to give it battle asking only that freedom of thought and expression which christian faithfulness demands during his active life years ago a ministering brother rev sawyer wrote of him perhaps some may think him wanting in refinement and grace and others i know regard him as at times bolder and plainer than necessary that he deals severely with some of his opposers is certain yet with all his severity there is a frankness and manliness which challenges the respect even of his enemies then it is but just to remember the school in which he has been disciplined he who has been called to stand at the head of the prominent universalist press of new england for the last twenty years must have learned ere this to defend himself and his course it has been no warfare for paper hats and silk gloves the head needed a helmet of steel and the hand must know how to grasp the sword and spear reflect for one moment on the batcheldors the mcclures the cooks the matthew hale smiths with whom mr whittemore has been called to contend and then tell me if the old soldier has not come out of the fight with charity and kindness worthy of admiration paul fought with beasts at ephesus whittemore has been scarcely more fortunate in boston upon the whole mr whittemore is a man whose life and character deserve high consideration he is supposed by some to be too much a party man and to consult with too much exclusiveness the interest of the denomination of which he is so prominent a member perhaps it is so but if this charge is sustained against him i hope i may be included in the same condemnation mr whittemoresstrong traits were positiveness of interest in the christian gospel he had a positive faith to promote and defend he seemed to realize the force of paulsstatements i know whom i have believed therefore we are always confident fervor he believed in christian earnestness and zeal was more afraid of frost than of fire in the churches industry this in him was indomitable one of his sayings was dead fish float with the tide live ones swim against it he was one of the living ones who stemmed opposition and wrought victories the grand words of our poet fields are illustrative of him souls that freed from prison bars struck the blows themselves have won grappling with their evil stars stand like uriel in the sun another minister of the same ancestral family was rev benjamin whittemore born in lancaster mass may died in mattapan boston april he was educated at the academies in lancaster and groton and became in early life a convert to universalism mainly through reading the writings of rev hosea ballou he felt impelled to enter the ministry he had successful pastorates in west scituate mass troy south boston mass and norwich conn in he took possession of the old homestead in lancaster where he remained ten years without pastoral charge but working in various ways for the promotion of the christian cause he was instrumental in establishing a universalist society in fitchburg mass in his later years he became blind but in spite of this infirmity he continued to preach occasionally repeating his hymns and scripture lessons from memory he was always heartily engaged in his work as an expositor of the scriptures he possessed eminent ability and in preaching his logical method and aptness enabled him to express his convictions with great force he was a sturdy defender of christianity against the objections of the doubting and unbelieving he received the degree of doctor of sacred theology of tuftscollege in his wife was mandana the third daughter of rev hosea ballou they were united in life for nearly sixty years his intellect was unclouded to the last and his faith grew brighter as his spirit took its flight an eminent and effective defender of the faith was rev dolphus skinner whose death took place in utica in he was born in westmoreland in and passed his minority in labor on a farm attendance at a neighboring academy and keeping school his theological studies were with rev s loveland of reading vt and he entered the ministry in the most of his life was passed in utica where as preacher and editor he proved himself one of the ablest promulgators of the universalist faith in the land the evangelical magazine and gospel advocate of which he was for many years editor had a large circulation he was a very popular preacher in central new york of commanding person with a voice of great volume and softness with the readiest use of language he was a favorite with the people his discourses were strong doctrinally and practically and his ministries at funerals were exceedingly satisfactory during his ministry of forty years he preached over five thousand discourses he was the author of valuable books and pamphlets his letters to drs aiken and lansing and his discussion with rev alexander campbell evince much ability he was a christian reformer the clinton liberal institute has been greatly indebted to his timely and unwearied exertions for its prosperity he was a christian patriot also and took a lively interest in the political welfare of his country the termination of his earthly life was peaceful i am an old soldier said he to his physician and am about to receive my discharge after a night of quiet from his protracted pain he entered that morning which opens the resurrection life to man a brother of dolphus was rev warren skinner who passed the great part of his life in vermont and who was well known there and in most of new england as a talented and useful minister his personal appearance was like that of his brother imposing and his discoursing if a little heavy in manner at times always methodical and sound he was a staunch friend of universalism and had great faith in its evangelizing power during some part of his ministry he was a useful expository writer in the church journals he did much valuable missionary work and lived to a ripe old age in full possession of his mental powers he gave a son to the ministry rev charles a skinner now of somerville mass illustration otis a skinner a wilcox boston rev otis a skinner was an honor to the church his native place was

reading vt the writer first saw him at kingston at the session of the rockingham association in he was just twenty one and a most attractive young man to behold a sweet sunshiny glow in his comely countenance which seemed most agreeably set in his golden ringlets of hair we heard him preach then at a private house to a very good audience in the evening he stood in front of the old family clock and gave us a very sensible and well arranged discourse from the text he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him ps

the new college he solicited everywhere and especially among those of like faith with himself indifference the averted eye or cold shoulder chilled not his ardor he drew by his persuasive words dollars from pockets that seemed at his first call firmly closed against him he succeeded in securing the amount needed for the endowment of the college and its necessary expenses superintended the erection of the buildings and at times when the means could not otherwise be readily obtained paid the workmen from his quarterly pastorsincome one of the proudest days of his life was that on which the corner stone of the college was laid since then the institution has prospered larger endowments have given it strength faithful teachers have honored it and its sons have gone forth bearing with them the evidences of the scholarship which can be secured to its students beautiful for outward situation a literary mount zion of the universalist church in new england it gives promise of yet increasing prosperity but never will it outgrow its indebtedness to its first financial agent who wrought so indefatigably nobly and successfully in its behalf in mr skinner was induced by family considerations to move west after residing in elgin kansas county ill for a few months he was invited and persuaded to become president of lombard university at galesburg ill here again was work for him as the college needed much exertion that it might prosper and he aided it essentially but the task was too heavy and after two years hard service his health gave way the death of his brother samuel occurring at chicago he was called upon to give attention to his financial affairs this was an additional burden too great for him to bear but still his spirit for a while seemed proof against his bodily weaknesses he removed to joliet and took upon him more than two healthful men could perform he would preach to his own congregation in joliet on sunday morning then ride five miles to lockport and preach at oneclock thence nine miles to plainfield and hold a service at three and then return home to meet a crowd of listeners in his own church in the evening this added to his

sept there was nothing of the flashy or sensational in the ministry of mr skinner he was a plain logical practical preacher in doctrine showing uncorruptness an able expounder of the scriptures and a faithful looker up of religious error his strictures on the revivalism of rev mr knapp in boston and his review of rev theodore parkerstheology in the universalist miscellany were good evidences of his fidelity to the new testament gospel and the intent of its work with mankind as a pastor he was not to be excelled he knew his flocks at their homes and personal attachments to him as a friend adviser and companion were very strong he was in this calling one of the models he received the degree of a from harvard university and that of from lombard of his brother samuel we may say that he was a man of more than ordinary endowments he was for a time in the ministry and preached some in new england he afterwards became editor of the new covenant in chicago he was a quiet and sensible preacher and excelled as a writer of clear compact and well arranged expositions of scripture many of which enriched the columns of his paper rev joseph oberlin skinner was of piermont born there in

vt his labors were many and successful his literary accomplishments were of a high order and he was a faithful and impressive preacher at the last of life he was confined to his bed for more than eleven months helpless but in quiet resignation to the divine will when asked if the faith with which he had comforted others was sufficient for himself in this great trial he answered in the affirmative adding i do not want any new revelation i am satisfied with what we now have he was a frequent contributor to the denominational and secular papers wrote many articles for the universalist quarterly and prepared a history of the masonic lodge of waterville which was very highly appreciated by the members of that order he was for many years the accurate and able editor of the yearly universalist register in recognition of his scholarly attainments colby university in conferred upon him the honorary degree of a nathaniel stacy born in new salem franklin county mass came to manhood at the close of the last century and after hard toiling in early life with but small educational advantages he concluded from sincere convictions of duty to become a preacher of the faith which he had embraced in early life he was small and feeble bodily but of sanguine temperament and great firmness and persistence of will he was encouraged by rev hosea ballou to leave a secular avocation and prepare himself for the ministry his first sermon was preached with much diffidence on his part but he was encouraged to persevere in his efforts and soon came to be a very acceptable speaker wherever he appeared as an advocate of his faith he itinerated much in massachusetts and vermont and afterwards much more in the middle and western states no preacher of the gospel was ever more engrossed in his work than he all the vicissitudes of an itinerantslife were his for many years yet his ardor never waned and his hopefulness helped him to meet all discouragements and surmount all obstacles he was a veritable christian apostle and was welcomed everywhere by young and old wherever he came as a messenger to the churches many remember his ministry with deepest satisfaction and his name stands high in the church as one of the most truthful and devoted of its evangelists his autobiography was published in quite a large volume in columbus pa in it is full of interesting incidents and apt and able expositions of the faith of the gospel mr stacy departed this life at columbus pa april rev stephen smith of this eloquent and honored minister his biographer dr sawyer writes few men have risen to a higher position in the denomination of universalists exerted a wider influence or wrought out a brighter or more enviable fame he was born and educated in the humblest circumstances being early led by the force of his own convictions to embrace an unpopular faith he soon found himself impelled by a stern sense of duty to consecrate his life to its promulgation and defence his health never the firmest was soon shattered by incessant application to study and the hardships endured in the early planting of universalism in central and western new york so that a large part of his life was spent and his work done under this great disadvantage but the soul that burned within him was superior to bodily infirmity and flashed and blazed forth from a frame so attenuated and slender that even those most familiar with him were astonished by the vigor and sweep of his transcendent intellect the youthful play of his fancy and the strokes of his wit nor was his moral character inferior to his intellectual endowments seldom does one meet with a warmer heart or a sterner integrity than distinguished him his pastorates were in new hartford clinton albany and buffalo and philadelphia pa he was born in albany in and died in buffalo in aged sixty one it was truly said of him at his death but one individual in the denomination can expect higher or more heartfelt tributes of love and reverence his eloquence in the pulpit was often compared with that of henry clay in the halls of congress it was the delight of the writer to hear him three times at meetings of the united states convention the last in boston in the school street church from the text and i if i be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me the discourse was radiant with the truth and electrifying with the spirit and power of the gospel illustration sylvanus cobb a wilcox boston a sturdy theologian as well as a conscientious christian was that stalwart man from one of the villages of maine the rev sylvanus cobb the title when conferred upon him was significant he was an able theologian his words in discourse were weighty his sentences often as ponderous as those of dr johnson and if called to controversial work longfellows village blacksmith was an illustration of him you could hear him swing his heavy sledge with measured beat and slow if warmed up in exhortation or appeal he was grandly fervent he never evaded the toughest theological problem proposed to him for consideration but seemed always in readiness to attempt a solution of it his compend of divinity is an elaborate work his commentary on the new testament an excellent helper in the family and sunday school and his discussions with dr nehemiah adams and rev hudson involving the questions respecting endless punishment and the annihilation of the wicked are highly creditable to him as a christian theologian as editor of the christian freeman for twenty five years and as a temperance and anti slavery reformer he waged a good warfare for the right he was pastor in waterville me and in malden waltham and east boston mass during the three years of his service as a lecturing agent of the middlesex county temperance society he was entertained more or less at the houses of clergymen on one occasion in dracut at the house of a presbyterian minister he was thus questioned by his friend i have been thinking my dear sir about your doctrine and it seems to me even if it is true it is hardly expedient to preach it for all men will finally be saved whether it be preached or not but if it should prove to be an error the consequences of believing it will be terrible you have reasoned erroneously replied mr cobb from having assumed that my doctrine exerts not so good a moral influence as yours here is your mistake you believe that we are here forming characters for eternity and that we carry with us into the future life and retain there the moral dispositions and affections which we cultivate in this life now if this doctrine of yours proves true i shall be an eternal gainer from the faith i cherish here because it produces supreme love to god sweet reconciliation to his government and a cheerful happy state of mind i would greatly prefer to bear through eternity the mind and character formed by my religion than such as yours must naturally produce yet i am not expecting the heaven of eternity as a reward i am more than paid for loving and serving god here i feel that i am godspoor debtor and i trust in his grace forever i was not expecting such an answer as that was the sole reply of the questioner mr departed this life in east boston in december in rev menzies rayner entered the universalist ministry from the episcopalian church he was born at south hempstead i nov his advantages for learning were principally derived from private instruction he showed early signs of superior abilities when very young he became a convert to methodism and before the age of twenty one commenced preaching as an itinerant he was ordained at lynn mass by bishop asbury he continued to itinerate according to the rules of the methodist church for more than two years when he received and accepted an invitation to settle with the protestant episcopal church in elizabethtown where he was ordained as a minister in that church by the right rev bishop provost of new york after a pastorate of six years in that place he accepted a call to the rectorship of the episcopal church in hartford conn where he continued ten years he next removed to huntington conn and took a joint rectorship of that town and new hartford now munroe he remained there sixteen years when from close and prayerful inquiry and study of the scriptures he became convinced of the truth of the doctrine of universal salvation he asked and obtained an honorable dismissal from bishop brownell of that diocese through all his subsequent life he continued to enjoy the respect and esteem of several distinguished clergymen of that church so much bishop brownell pledged to him at the time of his withdrawal soon after becoming known as a universalist he was called to the pastorate of the church in hartford left vacant by the removal of rev john bisbe to portland me he continued in hartford four years when he was earnestly solicited to remove to portland and take charge of the society there left without a pastor by the death of mr bisbe

and lansingburg and preached in schenectady fort ann hartford and other places for a year and a half he ministered to the bleecker st universalist society in new york city he resided in that city until his death which occurred nov he retained his mental vigor until a few days before his departure at the age of eighty father rayner as he was familiarly called was a remarkable man his mental powers were of a high order his social qualities made him always attractive his wit was keen but he had great tenderness and depth of feeling his appearance in the pulpit was venerable and apostolic and his preaching clear powerful and convincing he gave to the world some printed works which exhibit the clear and logical character of his mind while at huntington he published a review of a sermon on regeneration by dr taylor of new haven and another of a sermon by dr tyler of southbury on the perseverance of the saints this was replied to by dr tyler who was again reviewed in a pamphlet of sixty pages which closed the controversy while at hartford he edited a paper called the inquirer and at portland the christian pilot while at the latter place he delivered nine lectures on the parable of the rich man and lazarus he also published a review of a missionary sermon by dr tyler and a sermon entitled st paul a universalist while mr rayner was with the episcopalians frequent theological discussions took place in the ministerial circles on one occasion among other questions considered mr rayner proposed this has every human being a just reason to be thankful for the gift of existence he cautioned all who would answer it directly yes or no to consider very carefully before giving the answer because of one other question which might follow but all present were agreed in the decision that every man had just cause for thanksgiving for the life conferred upon him now said mr rayner answer me this if any of the human race are to be doomed to unending misery have such ones any cause for such thankfulness why brother rayner you are a universalist said one of the ministers but that has nothing to do with the question was the response you are all agreed i see in your answer a new edition of this valuable work with an introduction by rev dr miner mr balloussuccessor in the boston pastorate has just been issued by the universalist publishing house in this city it ought to have a

walks of life and by hard study and the improvement of every opportunity for mental culture became a scholar of excellent acquirements he was an enthusiastic believer in the gospel and one of its most eloquent preachers and defenders he was especially acquainted with the evidences of natural and revealed religion and well prepared to present them for the consideration of sceptical minds his voice was rich deep and musical and as a reader he could hardly be excelled this aside from their intrinsic merits made his discourses strongly impressive an instance is cited of a disaffected hearer who had concluded not to attend his meetings any more finding himself at the door of the church one morning after the service had opened in expectation of hearing a stranger preach mr king was there reading the scriptures the invitation in isaiahsprophecies ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters the hearer stood still listened attempted to leave and was held fast again he started but the words reached him incline your ear and come unto me hear and your soul shall live further resistance was useless his place in the sanctuary was taken again and held afterwards while he lived mr king had a large warm sympathetic heart and made the joys and sorrows of his people his own he was the life of the social circle and his fund of anecdote and good humor usually insured him a warm reception everywhere he had an unusually rich bass voice in singing his pulpit services were pervaded with a profound reverential spirit he was pastor in hudson portsmouth and charlestown mass in which last named place he departed this life sept his death was a christianstriumph of his eminent son thomas starr king what can we say that most readers do not already know and yet the man and his life will always bear noting and will never fail to be admired he was born in the city of new york dec he early manifested singular aptitude for study and deep conscientiousness his education was desultory but with his quickness of apprehension he acquired latin and french at an early age at fifteen on the death of his father he became the head of the family and worked for their support as a clerk and school teacher in the mean time he was an untiring student of metaphysics and theology one of his historians mr whipple writes of him he mastered the results of the great german and french critics of the bible to many of our present young students exegesis practically means exit jesus but king in all his eager quest of truth and dutiful acknowledgment of the service which the great german theologians had rendered to the rational interpretation of the scriptures never lost his original hold on christ jesus as the express image of god as the son who reveals to us the father as the ideal embodiment of a perfected humanity such a person had a natural call to the ministry his first sermon was preached in woburn in the autumn of in the summer of the next year he was invited to the pastorate of the universalist church in charlestown then made vacant by the removal of the rev chapin to boston he accepted the call and enjoyed a busy and happy ministry there until his urgent call to become the minister of the hollis street unitarian church in boston the first invitation he declined and made a voyage to fayal to recruit his health which had been impaired by his incessant labors the invitation was renewed on his return home and he was installed in his new place in december this course on his part was not agreeable to many of his universalist friends but they had no doubt that it was conscientiously taken by him and most of them always retained their good will and heart fellowship for him they knew that his work would be mainly in the right direction always and they were not disappointed as a public literary lecturer he was among the foremost in the land in april mr king took charge of the unitarian church in san francisco cal he saw a field there which he deemed it an opportunity to occupy both as a christian minister and an american patriot he entered with his whole soul into the defence of the national cause and in opposition to the traitorous intent of the secession conspirators in the pulpit and on the platform he vindicated the national honor and pleaded for the maintenance of the national union as his biographer mr whipple writes as far as regards the keeping of california loyal to the union during the civil war he ranks at least in the first file of its eminent citizens his reputation was not confined to the pacific coast but extended over the whole country he literally wore out his life in this great and glorious field of exertion diphtheria came finally and he passed into the higher life march his words at the last were i feel all the privileges and greatness of the future one of our ablest theologians and most devoted ministers was rev abel charles thomas born in exeter berks co pa july he was of quaker lineage his grandfather abel having been a distinguished preacher of the society of friends during fifty six years it was of rev a grosh then of marietta pa that he received his first knowledge of universalism in he went to philadelphia as a printer and was there encouraged by resident ministers rev s smith and rev fisk to enter the ministry he preached his first sermon in the lombard st church in november in the following january he became publisher and co editor with mr fisk of the gospel herald and universalist review in new york city writing editorials putting them in type conducting the correspondence and as he says writing his sermons on a pine board by night for he had begun his ministerial labors april preaching in a small frame meeting house on grand st in less than a year from the delivery of his first sermon he responded to a cordial invitation to become pastor of the lombard st church philadelphia which connection continued with mutual interest of pastor and people for ten years in and a discussion took place between mr thomas and rev ezra stiles ely which was afterwards issued in book form and has probably been more widely circulated and had a more permanent interest and usefulness than any other theological discussion in our country it gave to mr thomas a fame which will always be connected with his memory visiting new england after the discussion had closed he received a most cordial and enthusiastic welcome and preached in many places to large and deeply interested congregations mr thomas removed to lowell in the autumn of and took charge of the second church here he and his co laborer rev thayer started the star of bethlehem a vigorous weekly publication in support of the universalist faith while living here he established the lowell offering a new movement for that time and which elicited much interest in this country and in england after three years active and efficient work in lowell and after a few months travel for his health he went to brooklyn where he organized a society and was one of eight men who built the first universalist church in that city from brooklyn he went to cincinnati in but declining health and overwork obliged him to resign his charge in after a yearsrest he returned to his old parish in philadelphia twelve years later he was induced to go out as a missionary of universalism to england and scotland the required funds were promptly raised and accompanied by his family in may he sailed for england his time was spent chiefly in london and edinburgh though he preached in all the principal cities of the united kingdom and made careful investigation of the religious aspect of affairs there at the close of a yearslabor he was joined in london by his co worker in lowell rev thayer and wife and for six months they travelled together on the continent he then returned to philadelphia and resumed his labor there during the late war with its manifold excitements and fatigues the visiting and caring for the sick and wounded in the hospitals and his active interest in assisting the soldiers constantly passing to and fro made serious inroads on his long enfeebled frame so that he was obliged to resign his charge in he removed to hightstown where he preached two years one sermon a sunday as a labor of love he then spent two years in bridgeport conn preaching in danbury and other places as his strength permitted in the spring of he purchased a farm at tacony philadelphia which was thenceforth his home mr thomas was the author of several volumes besides the ely and thomas discussion his autobiography the gospel liturgy the songs of zion a century of universalism he wrote also some very useful and popular tracts among them questions without answers which has had a wider reading and attracted more attention than any other tract ever issued from our press it has had a circulation of at least a million copies the questions are strong awakening and searching rev thayer makes this brief but truthful statement of the character of mr thomas as a teacher he was a man of wonderful gifts his sermons were largely doctrinal expository and defensive as the position of our church at the time he began preaching demanded he was clear terse and logical and original in the statement and discussion of his subject with just enough of quaint quaker phrase to give it spice yet alive with the beauty and the glow of the poetsvision and illustration and sometimes when a sudden burst of feeling and inspiration came upon him he rose to the highest demands of oratory his eloquence became electric and like a full charged battery thrilled the entire congregation until every heart beat with the pulses of his own faith and fervor as a controversialist he had few equals his discussion with dr ely as an exhibition of the universalist argument was and still is the best and most persuasive work of the kind in our denominational history and admirably displays the skill logic fairness and manly courtesy of mr thomas as a debater as a christian gentleman he was distinguished for the grace and courtesy of his manners for his thoughtful kindness towards all for his remarkable conversational gifts and for the personal magnetism by which he attracted to himself all with whom he came in contact young and old strangers and friends alike for the last three years of his life he was confined to his home and quietly passed on in full assurance of the immortal life sept mr thomas was married feb to miss louise palmer of pottsville pa who survives him and is one of the active and efficient women workers of our church contemporary with mr thomas during his ministry in philadelphia was rev sa llion fuller who became pastor of the callowhill street universalist church in that city in we are indebted to mr thomas who in his autobiography has given us a truthful though brief account of the worthy man his mind was comprehensive his power of analysis was displayed alike in sermonizing and conversation his perception was quick his reflection rigid and his stern conscience denounced what logic condemned as a public speaker he was unequal sometimes he was tame at others mightily stirring by forcible thought embodied in unusually glowing language the average placed him in a high rank among the eloquent men of the age in every respect of social nobility i never knew his superior he bore through suffering toil and ruth within his heart the dew of youth and on his lip the smile of truth he carried sunshine into all circles of the young and the old the literary and the religious even the house of mourning seemed radiant in his visitations of loving trust his keen wit was without asperity and his ardent zeal was uniformly tempered by charity his beaming face was a true index of the inner man he united with mr thomas in a letter to four distinguished clergymen of philadelphia inviting them to lecture in the universalist churches in that city on points of doctrinal difference between the parties the result of the invitation was finally the ely and thomas discussion an instance in illustration of mr fullersaptness in emergencies is given in the companion and register of entering the stage coach for utica one day he found it full of passengers among whom was a somewhat noted revivalist of that time and his friend a deacon mr fuller soon became disgusted with the coarse brow beating dogmatism of the revivalist toward the unassuming passengers and took up the argument against him enraged at being foiled in controversy and overmatched in wit the elder poured out a torrent of abusive language when mr fuller arrested his vulgar tirade by saying in a dignified and authoritative tone stop sir not another word from your lips why sir you are making a mere blackguard of yourself not another word sir arresting the reply before it could be commenced not another word i tell you why you have already disgraced yourself and your profession and if allowed to continue would disgrace the company you are in and the very horses that draw you along the mortified man shrunk into his corner cowed by an imperiousness as much excelling his own in energy and power as it towered above him in dignity and truth but his deacon was determined not to be put down thus and spoke up with much spirit sir this is a free country and others have a right to speak as well as yourself most certainly my dear sir said mr fuller with one of his beaming looks and in his blandest tones most certainly sir and i hope you will exercise your right yes sir and i mean to exercise it sir i will let you know sir that i shall speak as much as i please sir said the now enraged deacon thatsright replied the very courteous fuller speak on my dear sir we wish to hear you speak yes sir continued the choking deacon and i will let you know that you can not shut my mouth sir oh no sir heaven forbid that i should attempt it i want you to speak so speak on sir we like to hear you yes sir and i will not ask your permission neither i will let you know sir that you are not my keeper sir said the deacon now almost bursting with rage certainly not sir was the very quiet but smiling reply certainly not sir i am a pastor not a keeper of swine a prolonged hearty laugh from the passengers finally died away and there was a great calm the deacon reclined in sullen silence and the remainder of the journey was enlivened by pleasant and profitable conversation between mr fuller and the other passengers rev william allen drew most of whose life was passed in maine was born in kingston mass dec he fitted for college in early life but adverse circumstances compelled him to abandon his studies and go to bath me in where he was employed as a clerk for two years he then spent four years at work on

religion until at about the age of fifteen ballous treatise on the atonement was put into his hands he read it with avidity and was greatly enlightened and encouraged he had hitherto thought that all sorrow and suffering were inflicted by god in anger upon his children for their sins the first sermon from a universalist to which he listened was delivered by rev kittredge haven from the text whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth heb xii it lifted him out of his doubts and sent him away rejoicing he went into a solitary place and wept for joy and upon his

silent sympathetic amens in response when his words were ended the discourse afterwards appeared in the gospel preacher a monthly publication issued at augusta me the rudiments of theological and moral science may be considered the summing up of mr williamsonstheological thinking during his ministry it is a notable vindication of the divine sovereignty a sovereignty infinitely glorified in the divine paternity although some of its reasonings savor too much of what is called fatalism to be accepted as practically healthful when men are called upon to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling it is in the highest degree helpful and hopeful to all of weak faith who need to realize that god has will and purpose of his own and works within his children to will and to do of his own good pleasure godsbeneficent sovereignty was to him the adamantine foundation of the gospel as strong and effective by voice and pen as the ministry of this good man has been there were those at the beginning of it who were inclined to wonder at his attempt to enter this profession light minded critics uttered their innocent witticisms and sober well wishers of our denomination very plainly hinted to him that he might possibly do quite as much service to it in some other line of effort than that of preaching but all this to the pure minded young soldier of the cross was but an incentive to renewed exertion they who doubted knew not that the lord had called him and had purposed for him a life of honorable labor in his holy service father ballou used to say when the lord undertakes to make a minister he always makes a good one dr williamson was thus made he has given full proof of his ministry and now having gone up higher his works will follow him one of the ministers of a long

pastorate here reached nearly the limit of thirty years as a preacher he was plain sound and forcible he never attempted great things in the way of sensational effort he had too much good sense and too refined notions of propriety to do that his eloquence was in the sincerity truthfulness and earnestness of his statements and appeals he was a clear and strong reasoner and had always good illustrations of his subject at hand incidents from his own experience were often made most timely and impressive in his discourses he was pointedly doctrinal and thoroughly practical in his sermons generally using great simplicity and plainness of speech but always giving evidence of a deep heart interest in the message he was delivering as a minister of christian consolation he seemed pre eminent in this respect no preacher perhaps was more acceptable to our people his calls to attend funerals sometimes at long distances out of his own parish were many old friends who had long known him when bereaved and afflicted were thankful to hear his voice speaking to them the comforting words of divine truth he was a true christian reformer all through his ministry this had been his

they united that silver wedding celebration of the pastoral union in what evidence it gave of that unity of the spirit which can bind a good pastor and an appreciative people for so long a time with interest deepening as years increase and which is such a reproof of the many injudicious calls and frequent resignations which afflict too many churches what a golden halo is set around this long

manliness that was in him and soon became an inspiration to his spiritual powers he grew in its light and his soul expanded in its genial atmosphere reading meditation and the culture of his mental powers soon opened the way for him into the ministry the work of which he entered upon with hesitancy not from lack of zeal in its interest but from modesty as to his qualifications for the great calling the counsellings of friends encouraged him and his first messages were received with favor and he became one of the most acceptable ministers and missionaries in northern new england of noble

its hopes in their sorrows he was welcome wherever he appeared as a representative of our faith his pastorates nine in number viz in lebanon danvers lynn and lowell mass hartford conn troy strafford vt and concord all gave evidence of his fidelity as a moral reformer he stood well without the church as well as in it and as a man he was esteemed and loved wherever known even the politicians conferred upon him the nomination for the gubernatorial chair of new hampshire not so much because of his service to them as a partisan as from the fact of the excellences in him that were above all mere party considerations and which gave them the assurance that his honest and sturdy manliness would prove an honor in any position he might be called to fill it afterwards appearing that his residence in the state had not been quite long enough to render him eligible to the office another nomination was necessarily made his death was sudden he fell of heart disease near his home in the

them the universalist reform association appointed him their corresponding secretary and an annual report on the topics usually embraced in their discussions was expected from him because as one remarked he got hold of everything he consecrated himself to his labors and in them he was abundant the poet quarles describes him thy lifesa warfare thou a soldier art satansthy foeman and a faithful heart thy two edged weapon patience thy shield heaven is thy chieftain and the world thy field his preaching gave evidence of his consecration to his work it seemed as though he could never tire of

his anxiety in this regard let me go for the day breaketh gen xxii and he went out into the fields of the lord to be his faithful and profitable servant astronomy was a favorite study with him his sermons were often illustrated and beautified by his presentation of its facts and he came to be a most acceptable lecturer on the science itself he had seven pastorates in new york and massachusetts and in them all was deeply loved for his admirable character and intense interest in his calling he was a son of song and put his soul into his verse what can be sweeter than his tribute to the

boston he was pastor in livermore and afterwards for twenty five years in turner me it is worthy of note that after a suit at law in which the town recovered the ministerial fund against the congregational society the people of turner by legal votes dismissed the clergyman of that church rev allen greeley and settled mr bates as the townsminister with true liberality on acquiring possession of this fund the town parish made a per capita distribution of it to all the societies in turner that each might enjoy its proportional share of support from the same fund mr bates was one of the best of country pastors he was at home everywhere and a welcome visitor in most homes where he went he was clear and scriptural in his expositions and in his discourses a workman that needed not to be ashamed he was a minister of consolation far and near and had many calls to officiate on funeral occasions no clergyman in maine was more respected and honored than he his departure took place at his home in lewiston me jan at the age of ezekiel vose a small lame modest but wide awake looking man was this minister as the writer remembers his first meeting him in northern new hampshire he came from the first universalist society in boston and settled in st johnsbury vt preaching there and in many other places in vermont and new hampshire for some years he had enjoyed only common educational advantages but was a studious man and a strong and clear thinker he wrote but little his preaching was usually extemporaneous not always very methodical in plan but usually successful especially in making his subject plain he could say a great many things in one of his missionary discourses and would bring them in quite miscellaneously but they were usually things which proved interesting to his hearers especially to those who had seldom if ever listened to ministers of our faith long remembered will be a discourse which he gave in the writershearing one winter evening in dorchester a large corner school house was packed full and the speaker stood in one corner with his little bible in hand his text was prove all things and so wide was his range in topics and so many things did he undertake to prove and so long and rapidly and earnestly did he talk to that attentive audience that it seemed as though no man in the same time could come nearer than he to a compliance literally with the direction of the text he was a sincere humble warm hearted christian every one who knew him thought and spoke well of him from st johnsbury he moved to orleans mass and afterwards to north turner me where after a busy and useful life he died in aged rev lemuel willis of windham vt was born april his father was a convert to universalism as taught by rev elhanan winchester and

stoddard marlow and acworth his subsequent pastorates were at troy from to then in salem and afterwards in lynn and cambridgeport mass and portsmouth at the time of his death dr emerson wrote of him justly he always preached well there was in his preaching a good basis of thought with a practical application and a tone of fervent piety but he had and has no earthquake gifts the city did not run mad because lemuel willis preached we have heard one of his supporters say that he does not remember one sermon that would be called poor but in all his salem ministry he never once startled his hearers his manner is best described by the word impressive steady work steady power and ever increasing influence and the radiation more than the example of a good life made him successful in the purest sense of this much abused word but not alone in salem but everywhere mr willis did good in his character of minister literally he was all minister he cared to know only christ and him crucified and to this end all personal interests were subordinate not alone in the pulpit but on the street in the house at the private gathering he was the minister but as he never put the minister off so he never put the minister on it was his nature to be a minister and he could never seem to be otherwise mr willis seemed the embodiment of a dignity not offensive but agreeable it is said that on one occasion he was in company at a store in salem with one of the orthodox pastors of that city who was a very animated and cheerful man in conversation after they had left the store a gentleman who had quietly listened to them both on asking the proprietor what clergymen they were was told and was asked to guess which one was the orthodox and which the universalist his decision was directly contrary

after his settlement in new orleans changes occurred in his theological opinions which led to the dissolution of his relations with the presbyterian church he was deposed from his ministerial office for heresy and was afterwards known as an independent minister cherishing universalist and unitarian opinions this change of relations however did not alienate his parish from him the church building at an earlier date had passed into the hands of the well known hebrew millionnaire judah truro and by his liberality mr clapp occupied the church and preached to his old hearers his services will long be tenderly remembered in new orleans during twenty seasons of epidemic cholera and yellow fever mr clapp was at his post of duty and by his ministry of consolation carried comfort to the great

more diligent work into a life he was emphatically an executive man and had the faculty of making all his plans and movements tell to advantage he was fond of theological debate and during the presidency of the elder dr beecher at lane seminary he sought to draw out that noted man in a statement of his arguments against universalism he received promises more than once from the doctor that his request should be answered to his entire satisfaction but the fulfilment of them was never realized mr gurley was a genial man and an attractive companion he made many friends in his life and will not be forgotten by the universalists in ohio who regretted that he could not have devoted the last of his life solely to the interests of the church rev enoch pingree was by birth a new englander

out upon the anvil he was a useful missionary no one could have been more conscientious than he respecting the religious qualifications of a christian minister his own character was the best illustration he could give of his ideal that was above reproach mr gilman had a stentorian voice when excited in speaking but was often slow in speech and to some hearers might seem at times wanting in animation it is related that while preaching in a country place in new hampshire one hot summer afternoon a part of his audience being hard working haymakers his discourse became somewhat quiet in its manner so that an evident drowsiness had taken hold of some of the listeners the speaker perceiving it suddenly paused for some seconds and then bringing his clenched hand down quite loudly upon the desk before him exclaimed good naturedly come brethren wake up and let us take another view of this subject the call was effective and both speaker and hearers were in sympathetic wakefulness to

ministry with but little scholarly preparation for it but somehow by divine grace he did quite an acceptable work as a missionary and as pastor of a number of societies god chooses his own instruments in his work and this minister was one without the graces of oratory he was a plain and often instructive preacher because he was usually highly charged with his subject and eager to declare it to his hearers if his illustrations were sometimes homely they were usually to the point and if they excited a smile carried a conviction he was ready in expedients if these were necessary to win the good will of his neighbors who might be strongly prejudiced against his theology i had hard work said he to get the kind attention of one man i tried many ways but at last as we were both very much interested in raising rare kinds of poultry i opened his heart towards me by occasional exchanges of choice eggs with him he could meet pulpit embarrassments coolly and more successfully than others might have done lecturing one evening in his pulpit at watertown mass he came to a place in his manuscript where the matter was confusedly mixed the leaves had been wrongly stitched together and he vainly tried to put them in order despairing of this he quietly and quaintly remarked well this is strange i thought i put these leaves in as they ought to be but they are so mixed that i can not make anything out of them i think i will say the rest without the notes and he did to the satisfaction as well as amusement of the audience he died somewhat advanced in years highly esteemed by all who

earthly ministry suddenly came to a close it was the second year of that terrible visitation the asiatic cholera and the city to which he had only just removed was awfully ravaged by the sweep of the dark winged pestilence unfalteringly at his post of duty in all those dark days devoting himself to loving ministries among sick and suffering and dying people showing himself everywhere an angel of mercy and consolation he fell a victim at last to the desolating scourge and in the prime of his grand manhood the good fight fought the faith kept the course finished he passed on to receive his

the maine convention is remembered as a clear and masterly treatment of one of the problems which has greatly occupied the religious thought of the day he stirred the consciences of his hearers he was outspoken as an anti slavery man when to be so was to incur the hostility of men of both political parties and endanger his success in the places of his settlement the temperance cause always found in him a firm consistent and able advocate and while he was thus efficient in performing the more rugged duties of his calling he was equally well fitted by the tenderness of his heart for the more sympathetic offices of the ministry the death of mr abbott at rockland me in was occasioned by disease of the heart aggravated by the fracture of a limb he was conscious and composed to the last rev

constantly grew in strength in the affections of his people in the opportunities for public usefulness serving not only his parish but the town the sure test of his worth is to be seen his character was so well rounded so complete so efficient in all particulars that no one trait seemed to predominate over another he was very modest and unassuming when tufts college conferred an honorary degree upon him it was so unexpected that though he saw the statement in the papers saw his own name he did not suspect that it meant himself but some other person he had given the highest evidence of his hold upon his people twice he represented the town in the legislature an experience which often breaks the pastoral relation and sows the seed of disaffection but he came back from that official service to a united parish his settlement in danvers was his only one calls to other parishes with strong financial inducements were declined he felt that the pastoral relation should be broken as

in his behalf and they shared with him in some measure his trials he died in the triumphs of the unfailing hope of the gospel and was buried by his friends of the church in the cemetery which his own

strong men were bowed in deepest grief i shall never forget the appearance of one old patriarch who approached the coffin with tottering steps laid his hand upon the head of the deceased and then placing it upon his own forehead turned away with an expression of the deepest sadness as though he had lost a treasure never to be replaced in this world i saw him again at the cemetery standing at

the gospel he was settled as pastor in java sherman buffalo jamestown watertown and lockport in norwich conn and lynn mass he was a highly acceptable preacher and wielded a fruitful and facile pen his little volume the records of bubbleton parish is one of much interest in showing as it does the trials of christian ministers and parishes because of the discordant elements in them and in the vividness with which some of the characters in the particular parish at bubbleton are drawn but his best work and one that evinces unmistakably the strong qualities of the writersintellect and the soundness of his orthodoxy in morals is his volume entitled the true story of the barons of the south or the rationale of the american conflict issued in it is a compact but lively presentation of the origin and growth of american slavery from its inception with the virginian colonists to the breaking out of the war of the rebellion it is an unequivocal statement of facts and an irresistible appeal to americans for the overthrow of the gigantic abomination of slavery and the defence and maintenance of that freedom signified in the immortal declaration sent out by our revolutionary fathers from this nation to all the other nations of the earth it is one of the trumpet calls to duty among the many that gave inspiration and life to that desperate strife which sent american slavery to the receptacle of things lost on earth mr reynolds is worthy of honorable remembrance as one of the heroes of that strife a discriminating writer has said of him as a preacher he was strong and often brilliant as a scholar his explorations were extensive and his acquisitions the gold refined from innumerable heaps of dross patiently searched out and as a writer he was master of a style which would have been his passport to the first literary circles of america he died at milwaukee wis august aged thirty nine years rev nathaniel gunnison a native of new hampshire was ordained to the ministry in

marked success at one time the bishop of the episcopalian church assailed him and not having a correct knowledge of our doctrines laid himself open to a searching review from mr gunnison the controversy was a prolonged one both oral and written and the result was that the episcopal church lost ground and members and the universalist church realized a corresponding increase the civil war in our country broke out towards the close of mr gunnisonspastorate halifax being in strong sympathy with the south he stood almost alone in his defence of the north and gave offence to some of the leading members of the society by his zealous exertions for the north while acting as deputy consul of the united states he subsequently removed to maine where he died of paralysis in while in the midst of his active labors his son rev a gunnison of brooklyn pays this touching tribute to his honored parent at the age of fifty seven the pastor of whom we speak was paralyzed upon the early morning of the sabbath the secret blow fell upon him but yet he went to his work and with half his body dead went through his sabbath service then came the weary months of battling with death disease was stayed by the vigor of an unconquerable will and dragging his heavy limb with right arm lifeless at his side he took up again the burden of his work the other day in the lumber of a storage room we found the old trunk which contained the sermons of this veteran preacher and there upon the top a package of huge mss written in rude fashion unlike the singularly clear penmanship of the remaining mass these were the sermons written after the fell shock came to him for at fifty eight years of age finding that never again could the accustomed hand hold the pen the old man had with his left hand learned to write and until the last week by week the fresh sermon came quick and vital from a brain which would not cease to work his busy ministry of thirty four years was a christian success rev

of the forces of that division of the church militant in his native state he was always to be trusted in his work and was held in high esteem by all his brethren as by all who best knew him in later life his scriptural investigations led him to accept the doctrine of universalism as the truth of god in which doctrine he continued as an acceptable preacher to the end of his days his espousal of universalism did not lessen the respect of his former brethren for him they never seemed to doubt the purity of his motives nor the excellency of his christian character he stood in their pulpits from time to time during his later years he was a devoted christian reformer he became interested in the washingtonian temperance movement in portsmouth in and whenever opportunity offered gave his word

inspiration and was signally aided in my endeavors after ideal perfection and practical goodness he was as true to his highest convictions of duty as the needle to the pole mr miller was a terse and

labored for fifteen years with exemplary fidelity and abundant success in him we have a striking instance of the inward force of christian character to overcome bodily infirmities and accomplish

winchestersreturn from england who preached a few times in the region where they lived and was followed soon by several others he early participated with them in their religious views and feelings and in due time became anxious to enter upon his studies for the ministry to this end he began the study of greek but as there were no books in those days with english notes and definitions it became requisite first to study latin finding a part of an old latin bible with a grammar and dictionary he plodded on through several chapters by close application he was able generally to read out a whole

volume of the gospel preacher in while in providence he delivered a course of lectures in favor and in defence of revealed religion which were issued in book form and are very creditable to the author and a valuable contribution to the christian evidences rev james wilson pastor of the broad street congregational church in providence had made some very severe statements against mr pickeringsministry and advised his people by all means to keep themselves away from it when however this volume was published he read it attentively and took occasion to say to his congregation that whereas he had warned them against the preaching of mr pickering he wished to call their especial attention to this book and assured them that the reading of it would be really profitable to them mr pickering was very agreeable in social life and had many warm friends he had some severe trials in his last days and departed this life in ypsilanti mich jan from to rev george rogers was an active itinerant and sometimes pastor in different states of the union he was at first with the methodists and came into the universalist ministry in the vicinity of philadelphia in preaching his first universalist sermon in the lombard street church where rev a thomas was pastor he was for a time settled in brooklyn pa then he itinerated in the states of new york and connecticut and afterwards journeyed west and ministered to the universalist society in cincinnati ohio here the field of his labors widened indefinitely his memoranda a volume full of incident and adventure issued in gives us the account of his varied experiences in city town country place and wilderness from new england to new orleans from pennsylvania to the then farthest west preaching the gospel of godsimpartial grace in all available places and at all available times holding discussions meeting rebuffs of bigotry and the pitiable opposition of ignorance and sectarian hate but in all and through all self possessed patient never losing heart in the mission on which he was persuaded his heavenly father had sent him his memoranda is an admirable book for the family library mr rogers had great aptness in adapting himself to circumstances in his pioneer work sometimes a belated hearer would drop in when he was half through a discourse and interrupt him with the honest question as to his text and topic that he might better apprehend the speakersmessage a request which the preacher would very kindly answer and then proceed with his discoursing once when preaching in lexington ky he was greatly disturbed by people going out after he had begun his sermon suddenly stopping in his discourse he said my friends i have always noticed that people who go out of church during service as a rule have more brains back of their ears than they have in front of them and if you do not believe it just notice the next person that goes out it is needless to say that no persons put their heads up for examination after that under similar circumstances when once preaching in baltimore he said my friends if any person here tonight finds himself in better society than he is accustomed to keep i hope he will try to endure it until the services are out as in the former instance this sharp rebuke was effectual it is seldom that profanity receives so sharp and witty a reproof as was administered by mr rogers to a tennessee boatman one day when seeking for a place where he could safely ford a small river he sought information from a person whom he saw upon the opposite side and the following dialogue ensued rogers hollo stranger can you tell me if there is any place about here where i can safely ford stranger go to hell rogers what is that you say stranger go to hell rogers what where is that place you speak of i am a stranger in these parts can i reach it tonight this witty retort so amused the stranger that he courteously told mr rogers that he was the ferryman and that if he would drive back to the ferry he would take him across when subsequently he offered the ferryman the accustomed toll it was flatly refused no said the ferryman i take no toll from you you are the funniest man i ever rowed across this drink i take no toll from you thus a witty answer turned away wrath he was in presence a modest meek man with thin voice as a speaker but clear and profound in his discoursing and in religious debate wary keen and pointed in his reasoning and like apollos mighty in the scriptures soon after his last visit to new england in his death took place in cincinnati rev a thomas who was present at his departure writes the valley of death was radiant by reason of the glory beyond we conveyed his body to the quiet burial ground in delhi near cincinnati i had introduced him to the universalist ministry and it fell to my lot to deliver the funeral sermon a monumental obelisk was placed on his grave among the active ministers of universalism in the southern states from to was rev lewis andrews a son of rev john andrews an eminent minister and journalist of the presbyterian church he was favored by his father with the advantages of a classical education and received the degree of doctor of medicine at transylvania university lexington ky he practised as a physician in cleveland ohio and in the region round about pittsburg pa his attention was first called to the claims of universalism on hearing a sermon by rev waldo in augusta ky mr andrews had requested the preacher to discourse on the parable of the sheep and goats he did not suppose the minister able to give a reasonable interpretation of it in the light of the universalist faith he was greatly disappointed however and though he came a doubter he remained to accept thankfully and joyfully the doctrine of the preacher for he professed to have been converted by that sermon he soon afterwards by the aid of rev mr waldo then of cincinnati entered the ministry and in became pastor of the second universalist church in philadelphia in he travelled extensively in the south visiting new orleans mobile and montgomery in the last named city he gathered a society and started the gospel evangelist a

published in baltimore md it having been founded in by rev a skinner after this removal to the far south dr andrews published the evangelical universalist like that persistent itinerant george rogers he journeyed extensively in the southern states preaching wherever a door of opportunity was opened to him the universalist register said of him in labors abundant in long and frequent missionary journeys and in the midst of opposition and great tribulations he like our other southern preachers had to fight his way in the promulgation of the doctrine of a worldssalvation dr andrews was steadfast in his universalism to the last he was generous free hearted liberal almost to a fault his prodigal generosity tended to improvidence the marked trait of his mind was activity all he could know he grasped at a glance hence though not profound he was ready for all encounters he died suddenly at his home in americus ga march in the seventy third year of his age rev charles mellen was a worthy minister and pastor in massachusetts for twenty seven years simple and unostentatious in his manners he was thoroughly consecrated to his work a clear and strong writer and impressive speaker his discourses were characterized by sound sense and earnestness he worked from love of his calling he was hopeful and active in the temperance and anti slavery reforms and was a son of consolation in his ministries with the sorrowing afflicted and bereaved who looked to him for sympathy he passed from this life in taunton mass while pastor there in aged forty eight rev henry a eaton came into the

rev a eaton until he preached his first sermon he first settled in hanson mass afterwards at east bridgewater milford east cambridge and waltham mass and in meriden conn overworking and injured health compelled most of these changes for in each place he was much esteemed for his labors and beloved by many friends the illness and decease of his worthy wife at east cambridge and his devoted attention to her night and day exhausted his vital powers and bronchitis followed by hæmorrhage from the lungs finally compelled him to abandon the ministry he retired to worcester and engaged in business for the support of himself and children struggling manfully with various difficulties having provided for his children and arranged all his affairs he calmly met death cheered and strengthened by the unfailing hope of the gospel may in the thirty sixth year of his age he was a man of deep consecration of most attractive social qualities whose memory will be sacredly cherished by those who best knew him his only son rev charles eaton is the successor of rev dr chapin in the ministry of the fourth universalist church in new york city rev a dillingham was a son of maine and a graduate of the harvard divinity school he had pastoral settlements in augusta waterville dover and norridgewock me and portsmouth for a time he became interested in the swedenborgian church and entered its ministry but without changing his views as to the final destiny of men while in this connection he writes i never preached the eternity of the hells nor any doctrine inconsistent with the divine benevolence and i never heard universalism or universalists attacked or spoken of in derogatory terms as to their moral influence by some church people without putting in a square defence of those whom i knew only to respect and who had treated me with a consideration beyond my deserts in due time he returned to his own church with the honest confession that he had found no better more conscientious spiritual intellectual or tolerant people than those he had left while in waterville he represented the town for two years and was chosen speaker of the house of representatives the second year other positions of public trust were held by him all of which he honored he was active in business fervent in spirit and devoutly religious few men had better qualities for a public speaker with a tall dignified imposing presence and a voice of extraordinary compass richness and power his speech was impressive and effective he was suddenly stricken down with acute pneumonia and died in aged forty six a comparatively brief but very active ministry was that of john glass bartholomew he was born in pompey onondaga co feb he had the benefit of a good common school and academical education was a lover of books and of intellectual effort his parents being universalists he was sent to the clinton liberal institute and after a time prepared himself for the ministry he first preached in his

the city of aurora ill he became pastor of the universalist society in roxbury mass where his ministry continued from july to january during this pastorate the parish was carried prosperously through a season of peculiar trial and the membership of both the church and society considerably increased in the year last named he accepted the invitation of the greene avenue church brooklyn to become their minister the expectations of those who had called him were high and his pulpit efforts fully met them but adverse circumstances prevented that prosperity all were desiring the church building was inadequate to the occasion and a failure to unite with a remnant of the old church of the restoration so disheartened the minister that he turned to a new field of work to which he had been invited in auburn his ministry here was highly successful his influence reached beyond the city in which he labored rendering his work peculiarly attractive he subsequently removed to syracuse where for some months he highly enjoyed his pastorate his biographer dr i atwood writes of him crowds flocked to his ministrations and he seemed animated by extraordinary energies but gradually he became aware of some insidious malady repeating its attacks on his vigorous constitution he sought various means to master it but in vain once or twice he rallied under new treatment and diet and came up surprisingly he made a visit of two weeks to his old friends in roxbury and boston but was all the time failing and with difficulty reached his home in newark where he departed for the better life april his mind was on his work to the last but the unfailing hope cheered and sustained him he was a preacher of remarkably magnetic power one of the most noted of christian ministers in the present century was rev edwin hubbell chapin ll of the universalist church he was born in union village washington county dec and died dec in the city of new york in his childhood he became a resident with his parents of vermont where he received his academic course of studies in bennington his father a rigid calvinist trained his son in the traditional theology of their ancestors but the creed proved too narrow for him to be satisfied with it in while with his father an artist who was on a professional visit to utica he first had access to a collection of books teaching a more consistent interpretation of the scriptures which he read with avidity he attended the church of our larger faith there and in due time became convinced that christian universalism was the gospel of the new testament after attending to the study of the law for a short time he gave it up and accepted the position of associate editor of the evangelical magazine and gospel advocate his powers as a speaker and thinker soon becoming evident he was urged to enter the ministry which after much serious and anxious reflection he concluded to do and began his preparation accordingly his first sermon was delivered in a barn at litchfield and he continued preaching in the vicinity until his ordination in in may he became pastor of the independent christian church composed of universalists and unitarians in richmond va in on his way to the meeting of the general convention mr chapin attended the funeral of rev thomas king at the universalist church in charlestown mass where mr king had been pastor complying with an invitation to preach in the church in the evening the result was an invitation for him to supply the pulpit for three months in december he was installed as pastor there he was next invited to become colleague of the venerable hosea ballou in the school street church boston and was installed there nov finally he became pastor of the fourth new york society and remained so until his death he first occupied the pulpit of the murray street church but this proving too small the society moved to all souls church in broadway where it grew to such proportions that a new and costly edifice was erected at the corner of fifth avenue and forty fifth street dedicated dec and named the church of the divine paternity during the years of his matured strength he ministered to his people while thousands of every name and creed came from near and far to listen to his eloquent words here on palm sunday march he preached the last time on earth and here on december was gathered the most august assembly that ever sought to honor the memory of an american clergyman every christian sect of the city being represented at the altar by its ablest divines while great numbers of men and women of all denominations turned away unable to gain admittance to his obsequies in the other churches where he had been pastor memorial services were held the public life of dr chapin was one of incessant action he was not merely a church preacher as another has written of him his was a divided throne between the pulpit and the platform for many years he was active in the temperance and other reforms and his magnetic eloquence made him sought by all associations of the kind that desired the presence of a crowd and a stirring and persuasive appeal then for five and twenty years he was one of the most prominent of a long catalogue of lecturers whom every lyceum must hear in his memorial address in boston dr miner thus alluded to the aptness and force of his appeals i remember on one occasion in the suburbs of boston when after discussing in a somewhat general way the great waste occasioned by intemperance he asked his auditory to reflect upon the waste that would be involved in gathering up the cereals of the commonwealth converting them into whiskey taking the whiskey down to the end of long wharf knocking in the heads of the barrels and spilling the whole into the dock and said he would it be any less a waste if you were to strain that whiskey through human stomachs and spoil the strainer what more telling exhibition of the vital diabolism of the whole business of making and drinking whiskey than is involved in that simple illustration the address of dr chapin before the peace congress at frankfort on the main in surpassing every other of the occasion in eloquence and power made his name known through europe and placed him among the greatest orators in the world his religious character was deep and strong an embodiment of consecration to christian principle the volumes containing dr chapinssermons orations and addresses are so many and their character in substance and style so uniformly attractive that we hardly dare venture on quotations from them even if space were allowed us as a specimen however we present his strong and glowing words in conclusion of his fourth of july oration in at the crystal palace in new york city men constitute eras washington himself was the embodiment of the revolution and may fitly personate to other men and other ages the principles of that movement but let not even the greatness of washington overshadow the merits of the least of those who labored and sacrificed in that early struggle come up before us to day from many a battle ground from many a post of duty from the perilous enterprise and the lonely night watch the pageant of this hour sinks from my sight this temple of industry with all its emblems of civilization dissolves into thin air these tokens of a great and prosperous people pass away this magnificent city dwindles to a provincial town i am standing now upon some village green on an early summer morning when the dew is on the grass and the sun just tips the hills i see before me a little band clothed in the garb that is now so venerable there are the cocked hat the continental coat the well worn musket they have turned away from their homes they have turned from the fields of their toil they have heard the great call of freedom and of duty and before god and man they are ready hark it is the tap of a drum and they move forward to the tremendous issue that drum beat echoes around the world that movement was the march of an irresistible idea the idea of the spiritual worth and the inalienable rights of every man out of which grow the stability of nations and the unity of the world a more positive and thorough expositor of the doctrine of universalism could not be heard from the pulpit than dr chapin this has been acknowledged on all hands by those who were most constant and attentive listeners to him but the great aim of his ministry was to make men know and feel the power of the inner life of the gospel he distinctly states this in the first published volume of his discourses the great end of preaching is to reform the life to reconcile man to duty and to god the great principle to be propagated and established in the souls of men is not this or that particular ism but the spirit of christ without this no denomination can be right no society can flourish no soul can live mr chapin was a poet as well as an orator some of his hymns long used in our church services are of great merit having the beauty of moore with the spiritual fervor of charles wesley the writer takes pleasure in transcribing one of them for these pages which was written from a sense of duty and at the close of a very hot day in july when we had been very diligently at work on the new hymn book compiled by us jointly for mr abel tompkins publisher in we were about to make up the last package of matter for the press the writer had prepared one or two hymns expressly for the book while such of mr chapinsas had a place in it were selected from papers and church service programmes of the time he was urged to write one then wanted for the miscellaneous department of the book the subject to be during or after a destructive storm wearied as he was he consented and standing at the desk wholly absorbed in his theme soon brought out the following which speaks for itself amid surrounding gloom and waste from naturesface we flee and in our fear and wonder haste natureslife to thee thy ways are in the mighty deep in tempests as they blow in floods thater our treasures sweep the lightning and the snow though earth upon its axis reels and heaven is veiled in wrath not one of naturesmillion wheels breaks its appointed path fixed in thy grasp the sources meet of beauty and of awe in storm or calm all pulses beat true to the central law thou art that law whose will thus done in seeming wreck and blight sends the calm planets round the sun and pours the moonssoft light we trust thy love thou best dost know the universal peace how long the stormy force should blow and when the flood should cease and though around our path some form of mystery ever lies and life is like the calm and storm that checker earth and skies through all its mingling joy and dread permit us holy one by faith to see the golden thread of thy great purpose run the closing of the life of this eminent man was in accordance with his whole ministry at his funeral services in the church of the divine paternity rev dr armitage of new york city in a most impressive address to the congregation took occasion to speak of an interview with him in his extreme weakness doctor do you realize now the sweetness of the promise of christ in your broken condition he looked at me with the simplicity of a babe but i saw a tear moisten his eye and a little tremulousness mingled with his voice and he said my dear brother what should i do without christ christ is everything to me now so he spoke of the loving redeemer i said well then may i have this consolation doctor of knowing that you who have been in the ministry so long labored so hard done so much to lift up other minds and pour consolation into disconsolate hearts that you to day realize the same breadth and fulness and sweetness of consolation in christ that you have ministered to others he simply made this answer doctor christ to me is all in all i asked him if it would be pleasant to have a word of prayer he made an effort to rise as if he greeted the proposition with great joy i said no doctor you can not rise do nothing lie quietly and i will kneel at your side with my hands in yours let us give each other to god our father to day he said well we will i bent at his side and with such simplicity and brotherly love and confidence in god as i could summon sought the blessing of heaven upon him he joined in the prayer he buried his brow in one hand and held my hand with the other he seemed to glow with love i asked the lord to give him strength and if possible to spare him to the church and presented those wishes at the throne of grace which any of your hearts would prompt under similar circumstances at the close of a brief prayer as i said lord lord grant these things to thy servant for jesus christssake holding my hand with a firm grip and lifting up his eyes towards heaven in the same ringing fervent strong voice that you have heard so often from his lips his whole nature said amen in

early training was under the influence of the theology after the kind taught by calvin and arminius being of a thoughtful and studious disposition however he came to see in the teachings of the new

the war of the rebellion in the office of nurse she rendered good service and wrote an interesting book of her experiences entitled hospital pencillings a friend and former pastor speaks of her

reminded of the logical clearness and strength of the elder ballou rev prudy le clerc haskell was born in louisville ky feb and died in oxford dec in her youthful days she was thoughtful intelligent

ministry she had been married but a single year when her earthly life ended the remembrance of an evening with her at a meeting in mt carmel is very vivid in the mind of the writer she had been deeply interested in a new church organization there and had induced a good number of young believers to become members her welcome and counsel to them were pervaded with the christian spirit living ministers it has been thought advisable to append to this record of the departed the names of a few of the living ministers now advanced in years who have earned an honorable reputation by their works during the time included in the survey here taken it would have been agreeable to the writer if the number of such could have been increased but this was forbidden by the limits prescribed to this volume besides as already stated it will be understood that this historical sketching is by no means exhausted that there is another and a larger roll of those passed on who have done faithful service in the redeeming army as there is a noble company of the living who are yet adding their good work to the history of the church and whose names and deeds may in some future day be truthfully and gratefully given to an appreciative public for this brief review we are able to take of the faithful dead and living let us be thankful one of the most aged living ministers of the universalist church

commission in the british navy as second lieutenant of the royal marines and was appointed to a frigate and sailed for halifax his war record was a short one however for with the peace of he was put on half pay he was never in any engagement with the enemy and as he writes my sword was never stained with american blood and theirs was never stained with mine and that i consider the better having

enjoys a deservedly high reputation his pulpit talents have always been appreciated by his congregations his discourses have indicated a keen and well balanced mind logical force and ripe scholarship in social life he has always exerted a salutary influence his wit and humor being admirable accompaniments of his gentlemanly dignity and sympathetic spirit he has proved a valuable acquisition to the

born in hardwick mass march and was educated in the public schools of his native village on reaching his majority he began his work as a preacher and did some effective missionary work as a layman in he was ordained and was settled at springfield mass where he remained four years during this time his faith being assailed by two ministers of the methodist church rev timothy merritt and rev wilbur fisk mr paige entered into a controversy with them and proved himself an able advocate and defender of the christian gospel the debate still exists in pamphlet form and is one of the most pithy and searching that can be found the spirit and behavior of the bigoted opponents of universalism are strikingly illustrated as well as the readiness and efficiency of the assailed one to meet and to deal with them mr paige was next minister in rockport and removed from there to cambridgeport where he was installed pastor of the first universalist society july he held this position until after which he took no pastorate but continued to preach frequently for more than twenty years afterwards and has been active in the ministry until within a few years in he published his selections from eminent commentators a work showing most conclusively the admission on the part of orthodox writers of the very ground taken by universalists in their explanation of many passages of scripture supposed to stand in opposition to universalism it was a strong call upon all candid inquirers after christian truth and has made its impress in the progress of christian thought since it was issued in he published questions on select portions of the gospels designed for sunday schools and bible classes his greatest work however is his commentary on the new testament the first volume of which was published in and the last in the work is the result of sound judgment careful research and close thought and is a monument of the steady and untiring industry of the writer it has been highly acceptable to those on whose behalf it was prepared while engaged upon it he also contributed to the denominational papers and gathered materials for the history of cambridge which was published in he has also been actively engaged in secular pursuits he was town clerk from march to january and from march to may and city clerk from may to october and representative in the general court in and he

minister of state three years he is now as he has been for nineteen years past resident representative of the supreme council of belgium one of the most noticeable events in the life of dr paige was that of the celebration of his eightieth birthday in the vestry of the universalist church in cambridgeport on the evening of march a large company was assembled and after a feast at the tables very impressive exercises followed rev a safford pastor of the universalist church presided and introduced dr paige to the company who heard from him a very appropriate and affecting address the assembly was then addressed by mayor fox of cambridge rev dr mckenzie of the congregational church rev drs sawyer adams miner and capen rev a skinner a jacobs esq the city clerk and capt cotton a letter expressive of his sincere and hearty respect for dr paige was read from professor longfellow a handsome illustrated copy of longfellowspoems was presented to the doctor bearing this inscription presented by a few old friends with their congratulations and best wishes on the th anniversary of his birthday illustration a a miner daniels pr boston on monday may the columbus avenue universalist church celebrated the thirty fourth anniversary of the pastorate of rev alonzo ames miner ll who entered upon his duties as a colleague of the late rev hosea ballou pastor of the second universalist society in boston in place of rev dr chapin called to new york mr miner was born in lempster aug his ancestors on both sides were distinguished by good sense and firm physical constitutions his remote american forefather thomas miner landed at boston in the same year with the elder winthrop and removed to connecticut with the company of the younger winthrop about his grandfather charles miner served in the revolutionary war and removed to new hampshire soon after its close thomas miner his ancestor was a descendant of henry bulman of the mendip hills somersetshire england who furnished edward i when on his way to embark for the wars of france with an escort of one hundred men selected from his servants and from the men employed in his mines for this service the king honored him with a coat of arms and changed his name to miner dr miner was so feeble in his youth that it seemed doubtful whether he would grow up into mature life but good care and judicious training wrought a change for the better which was doubtless aided by a vigorous will his education was gained at village schools and academies in new hampshire and vermont he began teaching between terms when he was sixteen years of age and in took entire charge of the scientific and military academy at unity his first discourse in the pulpit was delivered in february in he received ordination and was settled in methuen mass in he removed to lowell where he became an efficient yoke fellow with the pastor of the first universalist church and where they made good proof of their ministry in the pulpit and through the press dr miner remained in lowell as pastor of the second society until the removal of rev chapin from boston to new york when he was called to take his place as colleague with rev hosea ballou at the universalist church in school st on the death of mr ballou he became pastor of the church which office he still retains his health failing him partially in he visited europe and on his return found that his church edifice had been remodelled during his absence at a cost of subsequently in the building in school street was put to secular uses and the edifice now occupied on columbus avenue was erected at a cost of during his long pastorate two colleagues have been settled with him rev roland connor for a short time and rev henry i cushman now pastor of the first universalist church in providence i in after the decease of rev dr ballou president of tufts college dr miner was chosen to this office and took upon himself its duties in connection with his work as pastor in boston his energy seemed adequate to this double task for a time until it became evident to him and his friends that the interests of both college and parish required his main attention to be given to but one of them he chose the parish to the great satisfaction of its members and rev capen one of the alumni of the college was elected its president through his past life course dr miner has been one of the most indefatigable of toilers as a christian minister and reformer he is widely known his pulpit talents are of the highest order his clear strong and readily modulated voice his sharp logic often on fire his good scholarship his aptness not only in making his points but in the elucidation of them his thorough acquaintance with the evidences of his faith and especially with the scriptural proofs of it his directness in striking at the wrong as he perceives it with most telling blows and his uncompromising adherence to what he considers the right are sure to gain him a respectful and serious hearing wherever he comes before the public his many published discourses evince his power as a theologian and his little volume the old forts taken embodies a searching review of some of the over confident statements of rev joseph cook on the religious signs of the times it would have been well for christian truth and for some of the churches professing it whose representatives so readily applauded many of the stirring and sensational words of mr cook at the moment of their utterance in boston could they have listened also to a close and rigid questioning of them by dr miner the universalist church generally we think would be quite willing to abide by the presentation of its faith and the claims of it by him at a conversation circle embracing members of the radical club held in boston within a few years where all shades of religious opinion were represented the question is christianity a finality or in substance can any religion superior to it be given to man was proposed for consideration after various discussions on the subject from the purest orthodoxy to the most radical liberalism dr miner who had come in while the subject was under discussion was invited by the chairman to speak his statements were very readily made viz that the christianity of the new testament included the best religion conceivable by man meeting his deepest spiritual wants answering his highest aspirations after the purest life here and his most anxious hopes respecting the future of himself and the race all this is presented and its complete fulfilment with all souls assured through christ the promise of whose mission is that ultimately god shall be all in all if christianity is true therefore it will have no successor the discussion was at an end as a christian reformer dr miner has gained a deserved prominence he has been outspoken on the subject of capital punishment advocating its abolishment and in the anti slavery war proved himself one of the veterans it is in the temperance reform however that he has taken a strong and marked interest as an advocate of prohibition he is one of the leaders in the land the pamphlet on prohibition published in containing his arguments on the subject before the massachusetts legislative committee in the representatives hall is one of the most readable documents of the times his ready answers to the questions proposed to him and his telling questions pressed upon the advocates of liquor license laws on that occasion evinced a mastery of the situation not often realized in temperance conventions and conferences he has often some searching criticisms on the city officials in their evasions of the laws respecting the liquor traffic and on every available occasion when called to speak on the moral needs of the state and the moral responsibility of the people he is quite sure to give a few ringing notes emphasizing the temperance reform dr miner has been for ten years past president of the massachusetts temperance alliance as an educator dr miner has done good work he began it early and has never lost interest in it as president of the college a member of the state board of education and chairman of the board of visitors of the normal art school he has been true to it constantly his business talent is well known he is a safe and far seeing financier to whom the interests of the busy movers on change are somewhat familiar in all financial plans and operations demanding his action he is especially and effectively at home he is president of the universalist publishing house and is still one of the trustees of tufts college the degree of was conferred upon him by harvard college and that of ll by tufts soon after his resignation of the presidency of that institution he was one of the hundred boston orators having been called to deliver the oration before the authorities and citizens of boston july the positiveness and persistence of dr miner have sometimes had the effect to alienate rather than conciliate those who might conscientiously differ from him in their convictions of right and duty it is to be lamented however that where we find one possessing his degree of positiveness in what he believes to be right we are more or less troubled on every side by those who are only half men because of the low policies and expediencies by which they are governed his confidence in the right seems instinctive as he says a mountain can be tunnelled a principle never a boston secular journal just now speaks of him his honesty nobody has ever questioned if he hit hard he hit where he believed hard hitting was warranted and indispensable it is fortunate for the world perhaps that he took a liberal side in theology had he been a calvinist he would have been as uncompromising as any one of those puritan inflexibles who drove baptists into rhode island and quakers into eternity had he embraced catholicism heretics would have fared the worse for it and he could hardly have found his fitting place anywhere short of the college of cardinals with its possibilities toward the chair of st peter by the same qualities that make him a terror to his enemies he binds his followers to him with hooks of steel illustration thomas sawyer stuart boston rev thomas jefferson sawyer was born in reading windsor co vt jan his father was one of the earliest settlers of the town having removed with his fathersfamily from pomfret conn the son enjoyed very good advantages for acquiring a common school education and at the age of eighteen had gained such a mastery of the branches then taught in such schools as to become a teacher in which capacity he served three or four months every year until he entered his profession he entered middlebury college in the autumn of having completed his preparation after he was twenty one and graduated in as there were no theological schools to aid him he went to study with rev william s balch then at winchester who was soon called to albany mr s remained in winchester through the winter preaching occasionally reading the iliad of homer and studying such theological works as he had opportunity to find in april he went to new york and took charge of a small society there in grand street the chapel in which he preached had been built and was for several years occupied as an episcopal church it was afterwards purchased by the universalists in mr sawyer entered upon his ministry with his people in a new place a church on orchard street the church was built three or four years before by a small society of the reformed dutch church from which the property fell into the hands of two enterprising builders who had been the contractors for it when it was erected it was rented to mr sawyer for two years he was then a young minister of scarcely two years standing in new york and had entered the ministry only two years and a half before he had been married six months and had no cash investment four members of his congregation became his security for the payment of the rent and he in turn pledged for their security the whole income of the church pew rents collections and all under the circumstances he was assuming quite a responsibility the income of the society had been small and its receipts now were not equal to the rents alone besides universalism in new york had suffered greatly through the defection of abner kneeland and the consequences of his lamentable course were still fresh in the memory of all divisions and heart burnings still existed and the prospect was not greatly encouraging to the new adventurers yet it was seen that if success was to be realized a new movement as independent as possible of the old issues must be made hence this piece of wise policy in securing a new location and beginning church life under new auspices it was a bold step but a good providence had directed it mr sawyer writes of it i well remember the joy we all experienced when we entered the orchard street church the transition from the little grand street chapel which we had previously occupied was striking enough the church was large very large to my unpractised eyes true it had no side galleries as it had afterwards and was in every respect inferior to what it became but i doubt if solomon when he first entered his majestic temple felt more deeply impressed with its greatness or its awful sanctity than i did on the day when we first occupied this church it seemed to me a goodly place where as i hoped universalism was to be revived and restored in that great city there were prophecies of failure on the part of some friends but the persistence and faithfulness of the young pastor encouraged by his companion whose whole heart was in her husbandswork and his brave adherents by godsblessing wrought success in the city of new york was visited fearfully with the cholera it was suggested by some that the church should be closed during the epidemic and the members of the congregation were one day desired to remain after service to express their opinions on the subject many were about to leave the city and thought the church might be closed for two or three months and the pastor dismissed to the country at last captain packard a somewhat eccentric but warm hearted and worthy man rose and said that he should remain in the city and if ever he needed the support and consolations of religion it was during such seasons as they had already entered if the pastor felt alarmed and desired to leave he of course would not complain yet he should greatly desire to come up to the house of his heavenly father to listen to his word and worship at his altar this settled the question and the orchard street church was open regularly morning and afternoon through the whole of that gloomy and trying season and in this case as always the path of duty proved in the end the path of greatest advantage many perhaps a large part of the churches in the city were closed and the pastors gone the minds of the people were seriously impressed and the gospel of infinite grace proved itself well fitted for such an emergency the universalist church was uniformly well attended and great good was accomplished by its ministrations the society continued to increase old friends whom circumstances had alienated or caused to stand aloof from the movement returned one after another and forgot their former difficulties and discontent the best of feeling existed among the members and greatly encouraged all hearts though the reformed dutch church gave up their new house on orchard street yet no sooner had it come into the possession of universalists than the members of that communion began to express a most lively concern for the interests of religion dr sawyer writes the christian intelligencer their religious journal soon began to pay some attention to universalism and dr brownlee one of the boldest if not one of their ablest men and ministers commenced a course of lectures against the doctrine the lectures were repeated in the dutch churches in the city and briefly reported in the intelligencer an attempt was made to get them repeated in the orchard street church but failed the doctor was quite too busy to permit it his lectures were regarded by his friends as exceedingly able and altogether irrefutable he possessed a great deal of assurance and made assertions with vast boldness and emphasis as a reasoner he was but a third or fourth rate man the ad captandum was his forte and among those who knew nothing of universalism and undoubtingly believed in endless misery his reasons were satisfactory if not convincing the lectures were closely examined by mr sawyer before large congregations it was a grand opportunity and he improved it this review was afterwards given to the public through the press the attack intended to check the spread of universalism served to increase and strengthen it during mr sawyerssubsequent pastorate of thirteen and a half years other controversies followed with rev mr slocum a presbyterian clergyman he held a discussion that occupied fourteen evenings and added twenty families to the universalist congregation he answered rev mr remington a methodist clergyman and reviewed rev dr parkerslectures on universalism these lectures of mr parker had been preached and published in rochester some years before and were without essential alteration repeated in several churches in new york mr sawyer happened to possess the rochester copy of the production and very much to the astonishment of many he replied to the learned doctorslecture on the very evening after he had delivered it in the immediate neighborhood in the morning another debate was also held by mr sawyer with rev mr hatfield the substance of which was published in a small volume entitled universalism as it is it was a rule with this sentinel on the universalist watch tower in that city never to allow any antagonist of the faith whose position and character deserved attention to pass unnoticed or unanswered the orchard street church was emphatically a success after mr sawyer left it in it enjoyed the effective pastorates of rev otis a skinner since deceased and cyrus fay still useful and honored among our older ministers and others it has probably done more for the diffusion of universalism than any other single society in the state all the societies in its immediate neighborhood bleecker street murray street fourth street brooklyn and williamsburg were first formed by members of orchard street and may be regarded as offshoots from that parent stock it labored not merely for itself its own ease or aggrandizement but for the good of the cause a veritable missionary institution in the autumn of mr sawyer removed with his family to clinton oneida co and took charge of the clinton liberal institute he succeeded in converting it into a universalist school and opened in connection with it a primitive theological school from which he sent out about twenty five students more than twenty of whom are still in the ministry well and successfully employed at the close of he returned to new york and having preached for what was formerly called the dry dock society a year he returned to his old parish and continued with it until the spring of when on the breaking out of the rebellion and the volunteering of his oldest son on his farm at clinton and on account of parish affairs in that distracted time he resigned and went to clinton where he remained preaching for the parish there until january when he again returned to new york and took the editorial charge of the christian ambassador this paper was founded by philo price in under the name of the christian messenger of which mr sawyer was the theological editor for several years it passed under several names and is now published at boston as the christian leader united with the universalist weekly formerly issued in this city in the autumn of he removed his family from clinton to star landing and took possession of a farm he had just purchased there here he remained managing the farm and preaching occasionally until the autumn of when he came to college hill mass and assumed the duties of professor of systematic theology in the divinity school to which he had some time before been elected he was one of the original trustees of tufts college having called the educational convention held in new york in which resulted in the establishment of the college he was also chiefly instrumental in calling the first meeting in new york city to consider the necessity of establishing a theological school which resulted in the founding of the canton theological school and the st lawrence university of which he was also one of the original trustees and for several years president of the board he received the honorary degree of s at cambridge in among the published works of dr sawyer are his letters to dr brownlee and to rev stephen remington in review of their lectures against universalism the occasional sermon delivered before the united states convention of universalists in new york september endless punishment its origin and grounds examined with other discourses review of rev hatfields universalism as it is two discussions with rev isaac wescott on universal salvation who is our god the son or the father a review of rev henry ward beecher a preface to the philadelphia edition of petitpierre on divine goodness in endless punishment in the very words of its advocates boston an article in the north american review one of a series on the subject of endless punishment in the march and april numbers of besides the occasional sermon already noted he has preached two others before the united states convention one in middletown conn and the other at rochester in from the beginning dr sawyer has taken a deep interest in the literature of universalism he has written much for the quarterly and for the other church periodicals he was instrumental in originating the universalist historical society which has now a very valuable library at tufts college dr sawyer has been an incessant and faithful toiler and in all his work whether as preacher or teacher has sought the promotion of the gospel of universal grace his adherence to the work and advancement of the universalist church has been steady and unfaltering and his defence of the christian revelation as an authoritative dispensation from heaven through jesus christ clear and unequivocal in admirable contrast with the flippant rationalism and scepticism which have in too many instances found expression under the names of liberal christianity and free religion there is a church edifice in new york city in th street near lexington avenue which represents the second universalist society of new york organized in it was completed two years ago and is called the sawyer memorial church illustration tho thayer stuart boston among the older living ministers who have made themselves specially and constantly useful in the universalist church during the last half century no one is deserving of more grateful notice than rev thomas baldwin thayer he was born in boston sept having received the usual rudimentary training and experience of boyhood he successively passed through the grammar schools of his native city and at an early period in youth he entered the latin school under the direction of mr a gould the young student had testimonials that his diligence was observed with marked approval he entered college at cambridge where by permission he was to pursue his studies for the first year without college rooms under the tutorship of mr leverett the distinguished author of the latin lexicon for certain reasons he was induced at the end of his first year to abandon a collegiate course and from the duties of a college student he very soon entered the hawes grammar school in the capacity of an assistant soon after this mr leverett resigning his position as principal of the latin school in boston opened a private institution mainly with a view to prepare students for college and invited his former pupil to become his assistant which invitation mr thayer accepted it was while connected with this school that his purpose to devote himself to the work of the ministry was formed his first engagement to preach was with the universalist society in south dedham now norwood where he supplied the pulpit for several months this made his work quite arduous his duties in his school and those in the growing parish kept him constantly and closely employed in june mr thayer received letters of fellowship from the boston association and was ordained by the same body in the following december in april he accepted an invitation from the first universalist society in lowell and entered upon a pastorate there which he kept for twelve years while in this city as another has written encouraged by the large congregations which regularly attended on his preaching he was moved to consider whether it were not possible to meet the inquiring spirit of the people by a course of sermons under circumstances which would give opportunity to present the leading doctrines of universalism to a larger number of persons than could be accommodated in a church this thought was communicated to some of the leading members of the society and after due consultation followed by prompt action it led to the experiment of a series of sermons in the capacious city hall the immense room was filled with attentive hearers throughout the entire course he then proposed that in conjunction with his own labors in the church regular preaching should be held four or five sundays in the city hall and that a subscription of fifty cents from each person friendly to the project should defray the expenses incident thereto rev adams was engaged to supply the specified time the result was that to this day the meetings have never been discontinued the germ was originated which under the ministry of rev zenas thompson developed into the second society now worshipping in the beautiful edifice on lowell street from lowell mr thayer removed to brooklyn in his six years in this city were years of great usefulness to his church and beyond its limits he connected himself with the odd fellows and became editor of the golden rule a paper published in the interest of the fraternity in he gave a series of lectures on social progress which were reported in part for the tribune as also a series of lectures on the dangers of city life especially in reference to young men he was active in advocating social reform the efforts for juvenile vagrants and for the moral elevation of the poor dr thayer has remarkable qualifications for a christian minister teacher pastor and writer his sermons are always alive with thought easily and earnestly delivered doctrinally strong and clear practically pointed and plain a mixture often of forcible preaching not reading from manuscript and freest extemporaneous outpouring sweet and fresh with the heavenly fragrance of the gospel in his scripture readings at the opening of the church service he is usually very acceptable to the hearers interspersing the reading with explanatory words and brief practical inferences dr thayer is well known as an author in the early days of his ministry he published a volume entitled christianity against infidelity an able and a timely offering to the public a strong and candid appeal to the reader in behalf of the christian gospel from the universalist standpoint the work was some years afterwards enlarged embracing the objections to historical christianity by strauss and renan and replies to them a republication of this work would be timely now in this season of theological thought of religious drifting and doubt of indifference and scepticism his theology of universalism is a work of great merit as also his admirable volume over the river they deserve a place in the library of every minister and should find a home in every universalist family his most valuable work however has been done as editor of the universalist quarterly his qualifications for this service are striking in addition to the able discussions in the publications from the pens of other authors the department containing the editorsoutlook into the religious world his notes and comments on the times and his discriminating notices of new publications is of itself a rich and welcome entertainment to all who are familiar with the pages of the quarterly a review reflecting great honor upon the universalist church and which the universalist fraternity cannot afford to lose or neglect after closing his ministry in brooklyn dr thayer had a second pastorate in lowell with his old society during which a severe calamity came to him he was thrown from a carriage by a frightened horse and so badly injured that for some time his survival seemed very doubtful his many friends were deeply anxious and the strain upon his physical system was intense but through all this terrible sorrow his faith and hope sustained and inspired him and the lessons of his sickness and christian endurance were to many souls more impressive than any they had ever received from his pulpit ministrations it was a cheering event to hosts of friends that he was gradually restored to the calling he so much loved though with the effects of the accident upon him which must go with him through life he afterwards removed to boston and was for a few years the much esteemed pastor of the shawmut universalist church in this city since his resignation there he has frequently supplied pulpits in the vicinity of boston always to great acceptance at the present time he is engaged principally in his work with the pen notwithstanding the unquestionable qualifications of dr thayer as a public speaker he is usually inclined to distrust himself but no one of our ministers when called upon to present any question of importance at the public assemblings of the church is more acceptable than he his lively musical notes of christian truth and earnestness are sure to awaken a response in the souls of the listeners rev william stevens balch of elgin ill is one of the oldest of the universalist ministers now in active service he was born in andover vt april he received fellowship as a minister of the general convention at saratoga in september and ordination in claremont in june his first location was in windham county vt boarding in dummerston preaching in neighboring towns one sunday in each month travelling on foot to the several stations and receiving the payment of five dollars per sunday he remained there preaching in nearly every town in that region until invited to his first settlement in albany january being after a time worn down with over exertion he felt obliged to leave and was settled next in watertown mass to which place he had been invited before going to albany his health soon improved and he found himself in the receipt of a salary of but again his health failed and he was induced to remove to claremont in april he preached there half the time and supplied in hartland and springfield vt and newport until a new church in claremont was finished here he was very actively employed not only as a pastor but in doing missionary work in every direction in september at the general convention held in hartford conn he was recommended by rev dolphus skinner to a committee of the society in providence i which was there to find a preacher not committed to restorationism or ultra universalism in reference to which isms the parish was quite divided mr balch consented to supply three sundays not as a candidate for he desired to live in the country he was however invited and urged to settle there which he did after some hesitancy in march his ministry proved a successful one in two years the large church was crowded and a second society was formed in the city in he was invited to go as a candidate to the church in bleecker st he declined but soon after received a call to become the pastor there having become interested in what was known as the dorr movement and freely expressing his wish to have a republican form of government by a constitution and seeing a political storm brewing he accepted the call from new york and settled there in november in he visited europe intending to go to palestine the troubles of that year made it difficult to go further than rome in he was asked by two men not of his church with whom a third joined to go abroad if he wished with full permission and means to journey as far and stay as long as he pleased he was wise enough to accept the generous offer and travelled extensively in europe extending his journey to palestine across the desert and through egypt to nubia after seventeen years hard work in preaching lecturing and writing on religious and moral reform topics he became quite worn down and resolved to take life a little more leisurely for his bodyssake an exceedingly difficult course for him he went to ludlow vt in preaching there half the time and supplying other places lecturing and really working as hard as when in new york city he then had another removal to galesburg ill where he preached five years and again resolved to retire and removed to hinsdale in but he still preached in he was urged to come to elgin ill where the ministerswork was still before him in he entered the plea of old age and resigned purposing a visit to california meantime he was invited to preach a sunday in dubuque iowa the result was another pastorate he refused to settle but consented to supply a few sundays until the society could obtain a pastor he continued three years and three months not removing his family but staying there his ministry gave great encouragement to the church in dubuque in mr balch visited california in the city of mexico and last winter florida at the present time his health is quite firm as he writes of himself i am comfortably situated use no glasses except in dim light and am fairly content in contemplating the past still busy with the present and hopeful of a happy and immortal future when in providence i mr balch gave a course of lectures on language which were published in he also wrote a grammar of the english language explained according to the principles of truth and common sense published by mussey boston and passing through four editions in his volume ireland as i saw it was issued and in a peculiar people the first edition of which sold in eight weeks he is the author of a sunday school manual published in the business capacity of mr balch was evinced in his raising funds for the theological school at canton taking charge of the location plan and rearing of the buildings and selection of a principal he afterwards completed the raising of a large fund for the institution obtaining also for the library and securing the valuable libraries of dr credner and rev s loveland he devoted much time to the business of making the christian ambassador of new york a denominational paper and placing it on a sound financial basis his work in these particulars was well and faithfully done mr balch has always been a very ready and popular speaker with the masses the graces of oratory he has not sought but his talking power seems inexhaustible although in favor of fraternal organization for the good of the cause yet his ideas in reference to creeds and to centralized authority are not accordant with those of many others of his brethren who hold in high estimation the work he has done in the spirit and in the truth of the gospel illustration ryder black phot smith among the long and successful pastorates in the great city of the west chicago we may note that of rev william henry ryder he is a new england man having been born in provincetown mass the son of capt godfrey ryder july during the early life of the son it was supposed that he would become one of the fraternity of seamen as his worthy father had been but this seems not to have been the providential intent the parent did his part in sending the lad to sea in a vessel bearing his own name william henry but the experience of a shipwreck cured the young sailor of what nautical tastes he might have possessed and turned his attention in another direction he became anxious for the life of a student and in his eighteenth year entered pembroke academy he was a diligent and progressive scholar and while at this institution decided as to the profession upon which he afterwards entered at the age of nineteen he preached his first sermon in manchester and during the year following he preached frequently in concord in the same state leaving the school in pembroke he entered clinton liberal institute clinton then in care of a learned and efficient teacher dr clowes he preached frequently during his stay there in the autumn of soon after he was twenty one he was invited to take charge of the universalist society in concord to which place he removed and in november of that year was united in marriage with miss caroline frances adams who has proved a worthy and faithful helper to him in all the experiences connected with his profession his ordination took place in december his ministry here was successful the society had been formed under the ministry of rev adams while doing missionary work in new hampshire in faithful men and women had kept it alive through changes and vicissitudes until it realized a new prosperity under mr ryder which has continued to the present time after two and a half years of successful labor here he accepted a call to the neighboring city of nashua a larger and more promising field which he occupied to good effect while giving great satisfaction to his people he became deeply impressed with the conviction that his ability to serve the church in the capacity of a christian teacher according to his own ideal would be made greater by a more thorough course of study than he had yet been able to take or than he could take with the cares of a pastor upon him he therefore determined to spend a year and a half abroad in study and observation resigning his charge in nashua he sailed from new york to england landing at kinsale ireland and exploring the lake region of killarney he passed on to dublin and crossed the channel into england where he tarried awhile visiting places of historic interest and making the acquaintance of several persons who were specially interested in his own faith and profession while in london and vicinity he was cordially greeted by the unitarian ministers there and preached in two of their churches he soon crossed to the continent and came to berlin where he applied himself diligently in a course of study under german instructors for seven months he next extended his travels to palestine visiting jerusalem and many other noted places there he also visited athens constantinople cairo the pyramids malta naples rome florence geneva and paris from which last named place he went again to berlin he was absent a year and a half soon after his return to his native land he was called to the pastorate in roxbury mass here he had a successful ministry of ten years not only fully sustaining the high reputation which the church had long enjoyed but giving it new inspiration and vigor by the high and truly evangelical tone of his ministry in he was called to that great city of the west chicago then twenty seven years old and containing people he took charge of st paulschurch at a time when just such a helper and director as he proved to be was needed his discriminating mind and firm will and patience and steadiness of action worked effectively in building up the cause of universalism in his own church and giving it an honorable reputation in that great and growing city and out of the city and through the state and the whole west the influence of his teaching and work as a representative of the universalist church has been justly acknowledged he has done work for the christian cause that deserves to be kept in perpetual remembrance in the pulpit as a pastor as an earnest worker in all matters affecting education reform and the public weal he has been found constant and faithful in harvard conferred upon him the degree of a and in lombard university the degree of doctor of divinity in he made a second visit to europe and brought home many treasures of art which were subsequently destroyed by fire in the two great conflagrations with which chicago was visited the fire that destroyed st paulsand his own beautiful residence on an adjoining lot imposed great responsibilities upon him which he assumed and discharged with admirable skill he visited new england and returned with with which to repair the shattered fortunes of st paulschurch and such has been his administrative skill that notwithstanding the heavy financial reverses to which the parish was subsequently subjected their grand church worth is now without an incumbrance dr ryder himself suffered great loss by the fires but it is pleasant to record what one who knows says of him that he is still in possession of enough and to spare dr ryderslife has been crowded with duties as a preacher and pastor and man of business he has made his mark on public opinion and human life during the forty years just closing he has thoroughly identified himself with the faith and work of the universalist church as an expositor of its faith he has always been clear and positive and as an advocate of its work unmistakably emphatic organized church work state work national work mission work home and foreign he has continually urged the zealous and faithful women workers of the church have always found in him a warm hearty and outspoken advocate on all occasions when and where his word of good cheer has been asked as a preacher another has thus truthfully spoken of him he has rare power a model pulpit voice deep sonorous a manner of wonderful impressiveness a personality behind his words that makes every word tell and long years of sagacious work without mistakes re enforcing what he says so that it is safe to say that no mansword in any chicago pulpit on any question before the people goes as far as his in impressing the public mind dr ryder has what another has termed an impressive presence not in bodily size but in a pleasant dignity which is attractive rather than imposing an indication of cool self confidence is in every word and action he is thoroughly in earnest as a public speaker and as thoroughly sincere and fearless in maintaining what he believes to be the right of the subject under consideration a capital instance of this quality in him was given in the discussion of a topic that came up at the united states convention during its session in lynn in he had been invited to speak of the needs and methods of spiritual awakening and used great plainness and force of speech in reference to what he deemed some of the spiritual failures of professed universalists which needed amendment his matter was well considered and his words were stirring and strong an attempt was made to pass a vote of censure he had discharged a duty laid upon him and deserved the thanks of his hearers even though they had not assented to a word he uttered if they were convinced as doubtless all were that he honestly believed what he said and discharged a conscientious duty his defence and vindication of himself were admirable the attempt to censure so significantly failed that the author of the resolution very readily withdrew it a chronicler of the occasion wrote that it was worth a long journey to listen to that outpouring during the war dr ryder was a strong helper of the union cause active eloquent and untiring in his support of the government in manifold ways in addition to his other agreeable personal characteristics dr ryder is well known to those most intimate with him as a genial courteous and warm hearted friend and companion all his pastorates bear testimony to the love which the children and youth bore him because of the interest in their welfare which he so constantly manifested in april dr ryder resigned his position as pastor in chicago and has since with his companion made a voyage to europe it is not his intention to take upon him the duties of another pastorate but he will doubtless be always in readiness to aid as he may the interests of the church to whose prosperity his life thus far has been so constantly devoted the birthplace of hosea ballou in concluding the accounts of ministers here given it seems appropriate to add a brief reference to an event of recent occurrence to which the attention of the universalist public had been specially called we refer to the meetings held under the direction of the cheshire association on friday saturday and sunday the th th and th of august in richmond the birthplace of rev hosea ballou and in honor of this distinguished and venerated man during these days discourses were preached by rev quincy whitney rev s s fletcher rev dr s mccollester rev dr a a miner and rev dr emerson multitudes were in attendance and the occasion was deeply impressive and is significantly historical appended to a special account of the great gathering dr emerson editor of the christian leader presents the following description of the birthplace of mr ballou we are glad to give it a place in this volume stratford upon avon has its one interest for the great world in the happy fortune of giving to every age the bard who in the faculty for putting an almost inspired wisdom into verse that is not simply matchless but at a vast altitude above that of every other poet who has spoken the saxon tongue william shakespeare the little town of ayr would be nothing but a scottish post village but for the circumstance that robert burns first breathed within its borders but first stratford and then ayr for the english speaking world rise to an importance simply unique above every hamlet upon the british isles london and edinburgh hardly excepted those who with us fully believe that the future is to honor hosea ballou with a niche in the temple of fame as the peer of the elder edwards and as hardly the second of franklin who find in the treatise on the atonement the quarry where bushnell has polished a few boulders will further agree with us that the gazetteer of the coming century will put into conspicuous type and honor with some detail of description the new hampshire farming town where hosea ballou was born the compiler of lippincottsdid not know its claim to distinction when he summarily disposed of richmond as a post township in cheshire co miles s of concord in a recent attendance upon the grove meeting not the least among the inducements to make the journey was the opportunity to see the homestead where hosea ballou first took the breath of life and to explore some of the vales and hills his boy feet must have trod more than a century ago as we enter this little village a church at our right half a century old is the universalist church the members of which have nearly all left to be good parishioners at winchester keene and other more thriving and distant neighborhoods a little farther on at our left is a meeting house it is true to that classic cognomen it is black with age it seems hardly strong enough to keep timber board and shingle together it cannot be less than a century and a half old the very sight of it takes us back to a former and very primitive age the glass is held to the sash by bits of tin the putty got tired long ago and let go we cannot enter but we can look through the windows on the north side is the great square pine pulpit possibly one that never knew the smell of paint the square pews have high seats from which only tolerably long limbs can touch the knotty floor there is no grace of form no cunning device of architect nothing to woo a trained fancy in and of itself it is a hulk that only cumbers the ground why then did we look often long and spell bound upon this wretched old rookery and see therein a fascination not to be noted in the capitol at albany or the mammoth and costly post offices of new york and boston the answer is in the history more than a century ago rev maturin ballou preached regularly from that pine pulpit among the regular auditors possibly the most thoughtful of them all his little legs dangling from the rough benches sat his little son hosea on the morning of sunday our friend and host mr martin says to his pastor of many years the rev davis take my horse and carriage and show these people where hosea ballou was born these people include dr miner rev mr stone of canton rev whitney and the editor of the christian leader mr davis knows the way but in mr bowen who owns the farm contiguous to the once ballou territory he finds and calls a pilot and village antiquarian perhaps a mile east of the keene and richmond road a mile and a half from the universalist church on the hill right at the foot of grassy hill we find a strictly modern house and a very old barn and a much older corn house less now by a good sample than it was before we saw it it is a one story house with modern windows and three small chimneys mr bowen explains that house contains the frame within which hosea ballou was born and the form of the interior is substantially the same he was confident that the three chimneys were the same in material as the one big chimney of the old structure of the corn house near by mr bowen says that is just the same only it is older and is now going to decay knoll stream valley plain and high hill to the east in the woods of which run the fence or wall that bounded the ballou farm upon these time can have wrought but little change we saw them upon that sunday morning as hosea ballou saw them as child as boy as youth as man from that quiet spot so rural so out of the way so completely in the backwoods almost hidden by precipice and hill came the acorn the oak whereof is now strong and vigorous we trust with healing in its leaves the little boy entering that corn barn to get fodder for his fathershorse cows and oxen is that the same whose stalwart form first rose before us in the school street pulpit forty years ago whose eloquent tongue set the blood thrilling in our youthful veins whose majestic bearing seemed to us what it was that of an apostle it has been our good fortune to look upon the forum where cicero declaimed in orations that yet thrill to traverse the colosseum where trajan had a private box to walk the streets of pompeii whose pavements were trodden by resident greeks and strangers centuries before the advent of jesus but there is an ample niche in our memory left we place therein to recall reverently gratefully and with weird association our visit on the morning of august to the birthplace of hosea ballou richmond twelve miles from keene due south the town of hill vale and forest is largely deserted by man farms that once waved with corn are now covered with forests of pine the locomotive has never been seen hardly heard within its borders but its history is precious for what it was for what it bequeathed it shall live in history and in song our woman workers the first universalist woman who appeared in the pulpit as a preacher of the gospel was miss maria cook who preached before the western association in bainbridge in june she is spoken of by rev stephen smith in his historical sketches vol i pp notwithstanding the good impressions made by her as a speaker there were those who deemed so extraordinary an undertaking as an evidence of mental alienation a more enlightened and candid judgment in reference to this subject has since prevailed rev thomas farnsworth of waltham mass ordained in and rev alvin dinsmore of woodland cal ordained in argument on the right and duty of prohibition by a a miner april boston transcript of may rev emerson ed in christian leader rev hanson chapter educational aids the universalists like some others of the christian sects in america were at first destitute of the educational forces which have so signally aided and strengthened the more popular churches of the land they had no colleges no academies or theological schools at their command although some of their ministers were very respectable scholars giving good evidence of their literary attainments in their pulpit instructions and now and then an uncommon genius would appear making his talents specially available as a writer or preacher the larger number were more notable mainly for their plain good sense their reasoning powers their very intimate acquaintance with the scriptures and their aptness in the use of them in the defence and advocacy of their faith these last named qualifications gave the universalist minister a vantage ground in the elucidation of his faith which often rendered it impossible for a theological opponent however well trained as a scholar to sustain himself in an attempted vindication of his opinions if therefore christian truth could be thus clearly and impressively set forth by those of but limited educational resources how much more effective might it prove if thoroughly prepared and armed with a ripe and ready scholarship this consideration as was to have been expected in due time moved some of the wisest and best friends of the universalist church to take steps towards the accomplishment of this object and not for the ministry only was this advantage sought those who were needed to sustain the ministry were equally involved in the attainment of it every christian sect has been elevated and sustained in a great measure by giving its support to educational institutions the college the divinity school the academy if an educated ministry is one of the great aids in sustaining christian truth and the christian church so is an educated laity both would have their religion represented and upheld by the highest educational supports and influences of modern civilization besides christian universalism is a child of the light it is not of the night nor of darkness it would send out its inquiries everywhere into the universe in its readiness to prove all things and hold fast that which is good it would stand face to face with all the questionings that come up in science history philosophy fully persuaded that all these truthfully consulted will more and more confirm its great doctrines of god the divine law and its operations the divine purposes and their fulfilment the reign of righteousness and its final triumph over all evil as made known through christ the head guide and emancipator of man hence it could not be otherwise than that the enlightened universalist should be the earnest advocate and friend of educational institutions a notable evidence of this interest was seen in the instituting of tufts college in medford mass it was a timely generosity that gave it being on that pleasant hill which the centuries had piled and planted to be the candlestick on which charles tufts should set the light of this institution it was incorporated in and opened for students in its prosperity has been of steady growth its funds have multiplied and its endowments increased the last report of the president capen showing it to be no longer an experiment but a power the aggregate assets of the college at the present time including the buildings and one hundred

better facilities for a thorough education in connection with the college is the divinity school with its able and devoted instructors a professorship in the school was endowed by charles packard esq

more promising than at present and its friends were never more devoted to its interests its generous founder has lived to see this child of his many anxieties and strong affection one of the great joys of his lifetime and he richly deserves it the college was lately freed from debt its total capital is clinton liberal institute has been of good service it was founded in clinton in and removed to fort plain in and came into possession of the buildings and grounds formerly known as the fort plain seminary and collegiate institute it was the first academic institution set up by universalists

greek the institution is well endowed and is increasing in prosperity it is an honor to the universalist denomination as well as to its venerable founder and deserves to be widely patronized and

illustration thos a goddard smith this institution bears the name of one whose generous encouragement was given it in the beginning mr thomas a goddard he was a member of the second universalist church in boston and during the long pastorate of rev hosea ballou was the faithful superintendent of its sunday school prosperous in business he was always liberal in his contributions to the church and its charities which in a large city were ever making appeals to him from the time of the first movements for the founding of tufts college he was among its most interested and generous helpers and was one of the first treasurers of the institution when a few years since the infant seminary at barre became embarrassed a devoted friend acting as its agent determined to make a vigorous effort in its behalf he came to massachusetts and calling on mrs goddard whose husband had aided the school in the beginning the result was goddard seminary westbrook seminary and female college is a boarding school for young men and women near portland in deering post office stevens plains me the institution began to be talked of as early as a generous citizen of westbrook mr zechariah stevens had resolved to donate land ample enough for the school buildings and the needed adornment around them how his gift has been improved the present attractive appearance of the seminary declares the institution was chartered in and opened in it has had friendly aids from time to time one of them being hersey hall the gift of gen s hersey of bangor common and higher english courses a college

three complete courses of study the classical of three years includes greek and latin sufficient to prepare students for admission to any new england college the ladies collegiate for four years is offered to those wishing to take an extended course in latin french and german and higher english the school has gained a good reputation in this presentation of the principal educational institutions founded and sustained mainly by the universalist public it is seen what influences may go out from them to the honor of the universalist church the promotion of literary culture scientific enlightenment and christian civilization it may be well here as we speak of educational aids to recognize the instrumentality of the sunday school which has found such a good degree of encouragement from the friends of christian universalism it has been an outgrowth of the increased conviction among them of the duty of instructing the rising generation in the truth and life of the gospel from the beginning of the present century in america this work has been recognized the universalists in philadelphia and boston manifesting their special interest in it growth in this work has been gradual but encouraging and the sunday school is now one of the cherished institutions of the universalist church its interests are widely and earnestly discussed and the means for its advancement through the childrenspaper and teachers helper promise good results if wisely utilized in the future although still needing improvement the sunday school may be regarded with this church as with others bearing the christian name as an indispensable aid in the moral advancement and religious culture of the children and youth on whom will rest the responsibilities of the church in the years to come the sunday school cause was never more generally and unitedly encouraged by universalists than at the present time another educational aid worthy of note is that to be found in the circulation of the literature of the church its periodicals books pamphlets and tracts these have thus far done excellent work in reaching and awaking interest in religious truth where the living preacher has not gone a hundred fold more can this be done by a just appreciation of this great instrumentality the press it is always a power in the advocacy of any cause it will be in its tendency to deepen and strengthen the loyalty of universalists to the church they represent an active and clear sighted agent of one of our western colleges just now writes in my work for the college the closest readers of our church papers are the ones who have responded most readily to the call for help loyalty to our church among them is the rule while among those who do not take a paper he is the exception only who responds to the call nothing else can be so powerful an ally of the preacher in keeping the people informed of our schools and colleges and all other interests and that universalist family which refuse to take a church paper for the pittance which our western organ costs four cents a week not only lose much of interest and enjoyment but thereby advertise their own indifference to the best interests of the church strenuous efforts should for these reasons be put forth by the ministry and other agencies to place a church paper in every universalist home throughout the land the appeal here made will apply to any locality and more than this these readers of the church publications are themselves to seek a larger distribution of this means of divine enlightenment to others ignorance of christian truth at home and abroad in our own land and in lands less blessed with heavenly knowledge is constantly calling for this educational work on the part of those who are permitted to live in the light and cherish the hopes of the gospel of godsimpartial and efficient grace wilmot warren esq address before alumni june see an article in the universalist quarterly for october entitled the universalist origin of american sunday schools by rev richard eddy read at the ohio convention by crispin financial agent for buchtel college chapter the laity all the members have not the same office one body in christ and severally members one of another rom xii although in the biographical sketches contained in this volume those of the ministry are made conspicuous the writer is sensitively aware of the fact that many devoted and honorable laymen who have faithfully and essentially sustained the ministry are equally worthy of record for their works sake a separate volume such as we are not able to make up would be required to do them justice we take occasion however to speak a word in way of sincere and grateful tribute to these good and strong helpers through whom the ministry has received inspiration and strength no sect can live mainly on the dignity or piety or learning or good reputation of its ministry leaning too much on these it will grow formal and cold will fail to become an active force among the masses in the midst of the opposing hosts of this great world around it to sustain a ministry as a kind of moral or spiritual convenience to wait upon it chiefly to be entertained or to be satisfied with the respectable precision with which its functions are performed and thus to keep in good standing with the christian community and the observant world is different entirely from the intent of that great spiritual enterprise which the new testament upholds it was a significant saying of the rebuilders of the ancient temple that the people had a mind to work leaders priests prophets master builders were aided by others on every hand and so the work went successfully on it must be thus in the uprearing and strengthening of the walls of the christian zion with the diversities of gifts there is to be the one spirit one will and endeavor and the one glorious end constantly in view the direction of the apostle to the church at rome gives us the true idea we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another he used the well known illustration of the limbs and members of the human body to describe the several offices and functions in the church setting the right estimate on the diversity and unity of those who composed it giving to all their places and to each its share of the essential life work to be done of the true and faithful women workers of the universalist church we have freely spoken to the fidelity of the good and faithful men we would as readily testify names we may not mention for these once given we should be unable to decide where to close the record but this we can say and every faithful minister will bear witness to the truth of our statement that among his experiences none have been more uplifting than those connected with the co operation of true souls who have waited on his ministry and given their ready counsel and sure and steady support the minister of the city with his incessant toils and cares the country pastor in his quiet rounds of duty or the missionary evangelist having his preaching stations at long distances from each other all have been doubly blessed in their anxious and unremitting toils in the lordsfield by the cordial smiles and welcome greetings and generous encouragements of the lay friends who by spirit and action have been all the time bidding them god speed on their way how shall they hear without a preacher is a very sensible new testament question how shall the preacher be sustained and blessed by his hearers is another of equal weight and timeliness a society or church is to be formed a sunday school organized ways and means instituted to secure a financial basis to carry on the work of the church where rests the responsibility and where the directing and sustaining force but in the few perhaps who are to be depended upon in every such movement and who give confidence and courage to others who are gladly willing to do their parts with them a low tide comes in society affairs adversities have been realized and the faint hearted are prophesying failure who but the few stand bys are among the hopeful and helping those always readiest with their money always in their places at the worship service or in the conference meeting or the sunday school what would be the courage of the minister but for this loyal church guard ever to be depended on a church edifice is to be built or a church debt cancelled who shall lead in the business the minister yes if he can more conveniently than any other one but what shall his lead be without followers on whom does he most rely on those laymen who are only waiting for his word to begin the work their generous zeal will awaken new interest in others and this striving together of minister and people will insure success a pastor is out on a mission of private charity the case of a poor widow or sick and needy husband and father or some suffering and desponding one needing help and comfort is tugging at his heart strings and the immediate resources of his pocket are not equal to the demand what then he knows just where to go directly quietly to the counting room or store or farmhouse of that layman whose religion makes him glad to do good and to communicate and whose worldly store gives him opportunity thus to bless himself as he confers a blessing on others a college needs an additional endowment money is required the president or some other friend of the institution goes forth in confidence that on a truthful representation of the needs certain ones will listen with interest and liberally respond to the call and as the annual report at the next commencement declares he is not disappointed he has consulted the laymen the general or state convention makes its annual call upon the parish for its apportioned contribution to the funds for the general work of the church and its extension beyond existing parish lines for missionary operations in the waste places that they may be blessed with the light and joy of the gospel who will be sure to meet truly and promptly this call the loyal layman who has made himself acquainted through the church journals and from his minister in the pulpit with the just and holy demands of this enterprise and who has never indulged himself in laying back from it saying we have enough to do to meet our own parish expenses no he and such as he now cheer the heart of his minister and make glad sister parishes and add credit to the whole church a blessing like this cannot be too highly prized cannot awaken too strong a thanksgiving a faithful ministry the church must have or fail but this ministry to be strong and prevail must have for its fresh inspiration the hopeful eyes and ready hands and throbbing hearts of a constant and loyal laity chapter the present outlook no man can be assured of his own salvation except he see the same salvation in the same saviour for all men as well as for himself which is to love his neighbor as himself richard coppin that the errors connected with what has been deemed the orthodoxy of the past are passing away is undeniable we have been noting this on every page of this volume the christian pulpit and the religious and secular press are bringing out new confirmations of it continually take two indications first the emphatic utterances coming from the episcopal church in england and america it is rev charles kingsley who writes i preach to you a son of god who has declared everlasting war against disease ignorance sin death and all which makes men miserable those are his enemies and he reigns and will reign till he has put all enemies under his feet and there is nothing left in godsuniverse but order and usefulness health and beauty knowledge and virtue in the day when god shall be all in all it is canon farrar at westminster abbey who is awaking deep interest in his vigorous exposures of the hideousness of the old ideas of a wrathful god who would punish some of his simple offspring hereafter without relief and without end his volumes entitled eternal hope and judgment and mercy are full of references to the opinions of others in the past who have opposed these errors although most of them are not new to readers and students of universalist literature and are among the harbingers of that coming day when the absurdities which he assails shall be numbered among the things that were his admissions of the force of the arguments of universalist writers are such as will awaken new inquiry in many directions notwithstanding he takes occasion to affirm of himself most distinctly but i am not a universalist we can only say that if he is not he is doing no small share of a work which will tend to make others avowers and defenders of this faith others of the ministry in england like the late dr maurice rev frederick robertson and rev stopford brooke have given their testimonies in behalf of these higher and clearer views of christian theology in america such men as drs holland and phillips brooks are advocates of the improved theology the last named explicitly affirming his faith in the final salvation of all souls dr heber newton rector of the anthon memorial episcopal church at new york in his sermon on the death of the late rev dr chapin said that dr chapin knowing the feeling of the church against the new ism boldly became its preacher for he recognized its great and noble mission that sin had its recompense he never doubted but his doctrine of god is love was so eloquently preached that the theologians reconsidered their doctrines of retribution even the episcopal church he says in recently reviewing the articles struck out the one about eternal punishment when universalism began its mission religion so to speak had become ossified and rigid and it was necessary to meet the advanced thought of the age that some change be made in it the force that wrought this change developed outside of the orthodox church and it has been instrumental in banishing much of the barbarism and cruelty of expression which christians borrowed from the pagans the presbyterian and methodist churches have had their experiences in the agitation of these questions involving the acceptance or rejection of the leading points of theology held by them in the past but the freest and boldest utterances on this subject seem to have come from the congregationalist churches members of the beecher family have been quite conspicuous in their allusions to the old and abhorrent doctrines of calvinism as for instance mrs stowe in her ministerswooing and old town folks her sister catherine in her emphatic saying that as this theology is set forth there must be an awful mistake somewhere dr edward beecher in his conflict of ages a work ably reviewed by rev moses ballou and rev henry ward beecher who has just now affirmed that he will never more preach the horrible doctrine of endless punishment after repeating a statement he had made that the dogma of endless suffering is the cause of increasing infidelity dr edward beecher says that universalism is no longer restricted within denominational lines but is now diffused more widely than some suspect that the preaching of the doctrine is largely neutralized by a latent universalism within the walls of evangelical churches that some of the clergy dare not investigate the dogma endless suffering in an impartial scientific method lest they bring themselves into conflict with the creed they are expected to defend and closes thus meanwhile the creed doctrine of an endless punishment is seldom discussed from the pulpit and never willingly heard by the pews significant indeed is the closing of his volume on the scriptural doctrine of retribution even admitting that the doctrine of eternal punishment is the word of god it seems to be forgotten that allegations may be attached to it that shall make it to be not the word of god but the greatest falsehood in the universe at the congregationalist convention in boston in the difficult problem came up to be solved how they could state what they themselves had come to believe without appearing to deny what the fathers believed assembled at the old burial hill of the pilgrims in plymouth they affirmed their adherence to the substance of the westminster and saybrook confessions of faith to clothe this substance in verbal forms making it a true statement of the old theology of puritanism and at the same time a living thing of to day would seem to be an undertaking resulting in as great a confusion of tongues as in any instance recorded in the history of the past to keep intact the theology of the past in their churches is an impossibility for let us understand that the most thoughtful among the theologians of nearly all the churches are now beginning to feel the force of the question hitherto hushed down as it has been boldly asked or even whispered in the face of the theology of the past what is the divine responsibility in the creation of man it is the question asked by hosea ballou in his youth of his father a baptist minister would it be an act of goodness on my part to create a human being had i the power knowing that his existence would prove an endless curse to him a question which the father was unable to answer and which the son did not press strongly upon him this question though familiar enough to universalists and long made a ground of argument concerning human destiny has usually been evaded by the supporters of the popular theology as beyond the reach of human reason they have regarded the inquiry as to the responsibility of god in the creation of man as irreverent on the part of his feeble offspring but the question has been considered and earnestly examined and the discussion of it has elicited the most outspoken opinions as to the result of the investigation rev patton of howard university has recently spoken very definitely on this subject although he acknowledges that it has not been a legitimate one to be decided upon by the theologians of his school he affirms that the divine reason like our own we being made in the divine image includes the eternal unchangeable and imperative idea of right the practical synonym of which is love love being that which always everywhere and in all beings expresses the right or sums up duty he reaches the conclusion that god chooses love as the rule of his activity that when he creates rational sensitive beings by that very fact he put himself voluntarily into a relation which calls upon him to act upon the principle of love which gives them a right to expect that he will so act it is an answer to the question of abraham shall not the judge of all the earth do right and of paul is god unrighteous in agreement with this reasoning of dr patton is that of rev john miller of princeton who just now affirms a deformed god is a great light gone out from any religion and is the chief ally of infidelity god is not to be worshipped because he is powerful any more than satan is but because he is moral if he wrongs me in bringing me into being he is no sovereign to me in the same strain comes this testimony from miss elizabeth stuart phelps of andover in a late number of the north american review the bible meets us squarely upon the deepest and the highest question which the finite intellect has the right to ask what having made us at all is godsmoral attitude toward us when he thrust into space this quivering ball of pain and error did he mean well enough by it to justify the deed profounder than all our philosophy wiser than all our protest comes the sublime and solitary answer he so loved the world that he gave his only son this magnificent reply which theology has distorted out of its grand and simple proportions to which science has refused its supreme reasonableness the true human heart and the clear human head have accepted the contortions of faith and the malice of doubt have almost equally united to shake the hold of this great re assurance upon the world the world will have it in spite of both the world will have it because it is the best it can get and by all the iron laws of common sense it will keep the best till god or man can offer it something better even so amen at the present time the orthodoxy of andover theological institution is assuming new and strange aspects during the recent discussions respecting the invitation to dr newman smyth to accept a professorship at the institution this avowal on the part of the professors still in their places there is given to the public it cannot be denied that the doctrines of eternal punishment and of the judgment have lost their proper place in the teachings of the pulpit that method alone can restore them to a reflective age which refuses to put into them more than our saviour left in them and which brings them into accord with the knowledge of divine truth which the spirit of christ is ever developing in his church christianity educates men to ever higher broader more truthful conceptions of god the questionings of to day in christian hearts respecting the doctrine of eternal punishment are a consequence of the elevating and spiritualizing power of the gospel the church should seek out positions that can be held it should be in advance of its enemies this change it is affirmed by the andover professors is a natural development of principles which the new england theology has especially cultivated these principles have gained their rights only by hard conflicts at every stage the cry of heresy has filled the air but they have won the day they have banished the dogmas of guilt for adamssin of infant damnation of passive regeneration of the universal perdition of the heathen they have been attended all along by concessions concession of the dogmas that all men sinned in adam that adam was their federal head that the death of christ was only for the elect concession that elect infants who die in infancy include all such that we cannot fix the time when moral agency begins that none who die before this point is reached are excluded from salvation and so on through ever advancing modifications the path of new england theology is thus strewn with concessions concessions to an advancing knowledge of godsword concessions to truth very explicit language surely and yet in direct conflict with it there is the fact that the andover creed to which all professors of the institution must give their assent involves the doctrines of the trinity and vicarious atonement that by nature every man is personally depraved destitute of holiness alike opposed to god and that previously to the renewing agency of the divine spirit all his moral actions are adverse to the character and glory of god that being morally incapable of recovering the image of his creator which was lost in adam every man is justly exposed to eternal damnation so that except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god that god of his mere good pleasure from all eternity selected some to everlasting life and that he entered into a covenant of grace to deliver them out of this state of sin and misery by a redeemer yes the andover creed declares there is a final separation from the love of god which cannot wrest the erring soul from the grasp of death cannot bridge the grave cannot descend into the depths and bring up to life and light its own offspring christ himself may declare i will draw all men unto me the andover creed says no no salvation for the soul that has entered deathsdark realm no matter that christ has the keys of hell he cannot rescue no matter that the time has been foretold when death and the grave shall be destroyed when there shall be an end of sin when pain shall no longer pierce and tears no longer flow in opposition to all this the andover creed tells us as an essential part of christian faith as one of the inspiring strains of the gospel message that the wicked whom christ came to save will awake to shame and everlasting contempt and with devils be plunged into the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone for ever and ever how are these theological contradictions to be explained infidels are sneering at this double dealing honest christians are asking what is to be the issue of this conflict why do not these religious leaders state plainly where they stand and what they would have the churches accept and affirm as the truth of god the question has been aptly asked is the moral sense at andover institution paralyzed the situation is perfectly clear to every honest barber shop keeper or shoemaker and it makes a hundred infidels where the age of reason makes one it is a matter for congratulation that the christian world has been moved that its thought has been so largely modified and that it is our great honor to stand at the centre however men may hesitate to acknowledge it towards which these lines of influence are tending but why we must ask are not these professed friends of christian truth in all the churches more in readiness to acknowledge this indication and plainly state what they think of it why hesitate and stand in the shadow of their old errors when it is so clearly evident that they can be no longer successfully maintained and which do not represent their real opinions why not say outright we were mistaken in accepting and teaching these doctrines of total depravity election and reprobation infant and endless damnation and have come to see that god is the father of all men and that in all his dealings with his children he will act in strict conformity with his paternal justice and love are we to conclude that there is with them the plague of a confused moral sense which hinders the honest and prompt avowal on their part of the truth of that gospel of divine grace that bringeth salvation to all men to avoid the admission of the truth of universalism there are not a few who seem disposed to tarry at the half way ground of the doctrine of the annihilation of the wicked as though in these desperate cases of sinfulness the saving resources of the infinite love were exhausted and god could make no better disposition than this utter destruction of those created in his own image and capable of knowing serving and enjoying him forever strange that godschildren can so limit his saving love and power is there any instance of sinfulness that cannot be reached by that grace which so much more abounds than any transgression of men another conclusion which inquirers reach is that of the indefiniteness in which this question of the ultimate results of the divine government is involved as though on a subject of such unspeakable interest as this to every mortal there could be indefiniteness in a revelation involving the truth of mansorigin duty and destiny why not indefiniteness in this revelation as to the being of a god and his attributes as to manswhole duty as to the objects of christsmission as to the immortal existence of any souls no the eminent christian apostle will teach us all better as he does in his lofty assurance of the extent of godsclaims on his children and his paternal interest in them for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord everlasting thanks to heaven for the definiteness respecting this great question which the advocates of christian universalism have constantly maintained these hesitancies haltings evasions policies will have their day and through them and after them the truth of the gospel will find its open avowal and vindication here is the prophecy years since made by one of the ablest and worthiest of christian ministers whoso readeth let him understand a few generations more and the system you have advocated will be among the things that are only remembered you will abandon it but by degrees as the truth increases you will begin by first exploding the old notion that infants are damned and by avowing the salvation of all who die in early life then you will proceed to reject so much of your doctrine as to allow that a very small part of mankind here and there an individual will be sent to hell and continuing the work you will at length determine that even these will there suffer no other pain than the remorse of conscience next that their remorse will be no greater in degree than what is experienced in this world and finally you will give up the remainder first in confidential whispers among yourselves and then after the common people shall have generally led the way you will come out boldly and preach god as the father of all and the saviour of all many a one not now ready to acknowledge the claims of the faith of the universalist church has this mainly as his reason for it that it has not been for centuries past the popular faith of the churches in christendom there are great numbers of christians who have in reality no more plausible reason why they are not better acquainted and more in love with this faith whenever they have heard it spoken of it has been in such words as to lead them to regard it as a modern innovation beyond this they have not looked convinced of this they have not desired to look farther but they should a faith making such pretensions and appeals ought to be looked after men are not wise and humane they are not lovers of their race and its truest well wishers in the christian sense they are not in readiness to rejoice in view of the widest and most thorough dispensation of divine grace in the most extensive and effectual work of salvation through the one lord jesus christ while they regard with indifference the affirmation which the gospel makes of this very work with all souls is it true this ought to be the eager inquiry of everyone professing faith in the significance of the second commandment thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself where this love pervades the heart will not that heart seek every evidence that can be offered in proof of this most desirable of all results the reconciliation of all souls to the divine administration the divine love regenerating uplifting and glorifying all godsoffspring we press these questions home without a word of apology to every lover of christ and the christian cause if these hesitating ones of whom we speak would take up the examination they would find that some of the clearest and noblest minds of the past have given their assent to this very faith and that the doctrines in opposition to it are not to be regarded as past questioning when they have been sanctioned by generations involved in as much mental and moral darkness as most of those which have preceded us christ came to teach positive truth and his religion invites the largest and freest inquiry as to its claims and so this theology of the past will be investigated it is undergoing the process now in minds and in the midst of institutions where this old conviction of the superiority and sacredness of the past has been revered as it never can be again all the sects are more or less affected with this contagion of inquiry it will not be suppressed to silence it for a season is but allowing it to accumulate greater force with which it shall again make itself manifest said a speaker a few years since in a methodist conference in new york city what reason can be given for the difference in manifestation of conviction of sin between our day and the times of our fathers whereas we used to preach to sinners that an endless hell awaited all who died in their sins we now leave the fact almost wholly out of sight we say we believe that when men thus die they go to a place of everlasting burnings where the almighty tortures them alive as long as he the almighty lives if we believe this why do we not preach it now why do not our editors write about it and our bishops thunder it from their pulpits till the people tremble a brother minister present took exception to these remarks he thought that the christians made by what were termed the reformed methods of the day are as abundant in good works and their lives redound to the glory of god full as much as was the case under the machinery of fifty years ago we do not propose to go back on the operation of the holy spirit to day because he acts now in ways different from those of old a sensible conclusion the churches are growing growing out of unreasonable doctrines which had their origin in the darkness of the olden time and which must vanish away as the full day of christian truth comes in to gladden the waiting world christianity will stand all this controversy it was made to it is not only the wisdom and the love but the power of god and that endures and triumphs it needs of itself no alteration while it can suit itself to all the shifting phases of human history it is of itself like its author without variableness or shadow of turning it has the same fulness and adaptiveness now that it ever had says rev mr spurgeon men in the days of whitfield looked back to the days of bunyan and men in the days of bunyan wept because of the days of wyckliffe calvin and luther and men then wept for the days of augustine and chrysostom men in those days wept for the days of the apostles and doubtless men in the apostles days wept for the days of jesus christ and no doubt some in the days of jesus christ were so blind as to wish to return to the days of prophecy and thought more of the days of elijah than they did of the most glorious days of christ some men look more to the past than to the present rest assured that jesus christ is the same that he was yesterday and will be the same forever verily so and what he is it is our business in the present to ascertain how much of his fulness may we now be able to comprehend and so again we say the world moves the church moves the spirit of the all wise and almighty is moving upon the heart of humanity man advances this is the divine process for long centuries there may be but little comparatively accomplished then a new activity will be realized we do not expect to go back to the dark ages again the very last half century as we have seen has been more marked with progress than any other before in the worldshistory our own nation has given signal evidence of this our declaration of independence has an increased luminousness at the present hour that the next half century will have equal advancement we are not sure but all signs are hopeful that there will be more growth continued improvement one thing seems evident in reference to our own nation which is that the religion of the gospel is needed in it more than ever before to meet its increasing needs and to give it strength of character and permanent life truer words were never spoken than those by the orator at the yorktown centenary celebration during the past year no advanced thought no mystical philosophy glittering abstractions no swelling phrases about freedom not even science with all its marvellous inventions and discoveries can help us much in sustaining this republic still less can any godless theories of creation or any infidel attempts to rule out the redeemer from his rightful supremacy in our hearts afford us any hope of security in that way lies despair commonplace truths old familiar teachings the ten commandments the sermon on the mount the farewell address of washington honesty virtue patriotism universal education are what the world most needs in these days and our own part of the world as much as any other part without these we are lost with these and with the blessing of god which is sure to follow them we may confidently look forward if we are reading the signs of the present and the indications of the future aright we readily conclude that it is but early day yet in the history of humanity we mean in its moral and spiritual history gross darkness fearful wrong appalling sin yet afflict and demean it if we have the gain of the past to encourage us if we would be aids in the worldsprogress the new instrumentalities of the present which we possess must be used as though we had full faith in their power that is in the divine indications that are in them if the true millennium is yet afar off it is advancing so should we be not as children of the night nor of any darkness of the past but of the christian day which has had its heavenly breaking and whose rising bids us to be risen also and to be moving on we are debtors to the past how great we can never fully realize we are equally debtors to the future what can we now do for its largest blessing its permanent life seeing that these errors delusions and wrongs of the past are to be dissolved what is the work of the universalist church now and in the time to come the answer is ready it is to magnify its office to extend the spirit and life of its holy faith it is false to its trust if it fail to do this it is to advance strong in the lord and in the power of his might to boast of its grand conceptions of truth its reasonable interpretations of the bible of its pre eminence in any way and still to have no quickening power in the work it is called to do is not to seek advancement and success but to court disappointment and failure this highly favored church then should offer to the acceptance of the world a positive faith at this peculiarly transitional time in the christian church history great watchfulness and discrimination are needed on the part of those who are regarded by the majority of the churches as liberal christians because this word liberal is often quite vague in its meaning and covers very many phases of belief and unbelief scepticism and credulity a candid and able writer of the unitarian fraternity has just given to the public these very timely and wholesome suggestions liberal christians will make a fatal mistake if they dream of gaining strength and influence by statements so nebulous and so universally inclusive that even those who deny all spiritualities can ally themselves with them and speak from their pulpits if they intend to form a debating club or a school of philosophy they might naturally and wisely pursue such a policy but if they wish to form a church with a faith to offer to the world and a positive and definite work for a definite end such a course is self destructive the effort of liberal christianity should have been to strengthen the things that remain instead of that its work has tended too much to minimize faith and to maximize doubt everything has become the subject of dissection almost nothing the object of enthusiasm and trust that religious body whose supreme function is criticism however skilful it may be in special work will never be a regenerating power in human society well said and this leads us to speak directly and freely on the subject of creeds as connected with all christian churches and especially as involving the policy and duty of the so called liberal churches we know that at the present time many are cutting themselves away from old creeds such as have held them and their ancestors before them when there is more religious inquiry abroad than ever before and when it is becoming quite fashionable to speak lightly of all creeds and to intimate that on the whole the church and the world may get along about as well without them as with them perhaps much better without them it is well as this impatience of creeds is increasing to think soberly if possible on the whole matter what is a creed let us begin at the beginning the dictionary creed comes from the latin credo and signifies to believe it is a summary of christian belief or of the articles of faith any profession of that which is believed a statement of the articles of belief as the creeds of political parties all religionists have creeds of some kind from the most liberal to the most exclusive of them take the most radical free religionist you can find and ask him immediately after you have heard him berating creeds and adjudging all as bigots who would be bound by them what he believes and as surely as he says anything he will state to you what and this is his creed whether he calls it so or not he might as well deny that he has a head by calling it something else or by not allowing it to have any name a creed he has if he believes anything the same of all men what then is the objection to creeds why that the church has been full of bad creeds narrow creeds unreasonable creeds contradictory creeds creeds dishonorable to god and to humanity there is no doubt of this and the evil still abounds but what then away with all creeds you cannot do it a creed you will have at last after all you have thought and said and done against having one it is inevitable most of the creeds of the church for centuries past have contained doctrines revolting to the common sense and to the holiest affections of mankind the church and the world are outgrowing them and they must be put away there will be no rest nor peace for those who hold and defend them until they are put away but what more will there be nothing instead of these falsehoods in the forms of human creeds are there no truths to take the place of them every reasonable mind concludes that there are better views of god and man will be taken more reasonable and scriptural doctrines will be accepted and these will go to make up the new creeds if these new creeds have errors in them then there will be new siftings in the controversies that will be continued on the old apostolic principle prove all things hold fast that which is good notice to be continually questioning is not the great object of christian investigation there is something to be held fast it is that truth which will commend itself to every mansconscience in the sight of god this will constitute the perfected christian creed at last just as surely as that every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that jesus is lord to the glory of god the father because the churches have not yet the right creed is no reason why they may not be seeking for it and may not one day find and adopt it we do not mean of course that all minds can be alike but that all minds will unite in acknowledging certain truths such as the divine paternity the human brotherhood the necessity of personal holiness the divine and human mission of jesus the immortality holiness and happiness of mankind if these are truths as we believe they are they will constitute a part at least of the christian creeds of the churches to what then does this sweeping denunciation of creeds amount may not much of it be of very questionable utility and soundness we know that good and wise men talk thus but are good and great men even always sure of being right in their statements and conclusions one of our distinguished public men mr wendell phillips said in his discourse on christianity a battle not a dream that the new testament was nothing but the new testament and that nothing like a creed could be tortured out of it nothing like universalism catholicism or unitarianism we have as little faith in the torturing process as he but we utterly deny that a universalist creed cannot be clearly and undeniably found in the new testament we have already stated a part of it if the fatherhood of god the brotherhood of the race the unceasing obligation of man to love god and his fellow creatures the lordship and mission of christ the saviour of the world the immortality of all mankind are not positive doctrines of the new testament then no doctrines no precepts no principles can be proved from it this is the very question at issue between universalists and those who deny that their faith has its foundations in the new testament we are ready to stand on this issue with all who will meet us there as honest inquirers after truth a gifted and highly honored member of the fraternity of friends took occasion some time since to speak lightly of an attempt on their part to tinker a creed for themselves and why might they not do it if not satisfied with their present statement of faith they have a right to search for that which will enable them to make a better one tinkering what are we all doing in our investigations and conclusions but just this rather poor workmen most of us but here in this great workshop god has given us we have a right to keep hammering and welding away a right and a duty to see how perfect a piece of work we may show as the result of our patient and persistent labor newton deemed himself but a picker up of pebbles while the great ocean of truth lay all unexplored before him our best searching will only give us indications of that truth which is infinite yet this is no reason why we should not be looking for it and stating it when we think we have found it god will accept even our homeliest work when honestly done when done beneath his laws even servile labors shine so in reasonsname do not let us be afraid of tinkering on creeds any more than we should be ashamed to be diggers hammerers furnace workers and explorers in the fields of science truth will come of it all truth that shall be worked into a good creed at last universalists have a creed its articles we believe are reasonable and uncontradictory commending themselves to the clearest intellect and to the holiest affections of mankind their principal creed or confession is a short one yet remarkably comprehensive it can be and is enlarged and in this form adopted in many of the churches the world asks what universalists believe they have been in existence as a sect long enough to tell them and ought to be in readiness to do this yea anxious to do it because of their convictions of the need of this truth in the understandings and hearts of men our unitarian neighbors have been much troubled with the fact that many of their own people especially their younger ones have not known what unitarians believed what were the articles or doctrinal statements of their creed just one thing surely that they and others ought to know if universalists have had any defect of this kind it should cease to be with them especially if they have definite convictions of christian doctrines such as the divine paternity the brotherhood of man christ the holy spirit regeneration retribution forgiveness atonement salvation immortality if they have not definite convictions respecting them let them say so honestly as in the hearing of all men otherwise let them have a positive creed to state and defend a positive creed we say for to have a creed made up of statements that are questionable in the minds of its defenders is to have anything but a new testament a truly christian creed the apostles had no such creed their creed reads thus to us there is one god the father of whom are all things and we by him christ is made unto us wisdom righteousness sanctification and redemption now is christ risen and become the first fruits of them that slept god will have all men to be saved and to come unto the knowledge of the truth god shall be all in all with them these were not questions open for self settlement in their minds but truths of which they were thoroughly convinced and in the promulgation of which they were most thoroughly in earnest this is the christian ministry now needed not a ministry made up of inquirers and sceptics mainly who are ever learning and never able to come to a knowledge of the truth but of those who have settled convictions of what the truth of god is and who are in readiness to state and maintain a creed which they believe to be every way in accordance with reason with the scriptures and in answer to the most earnest and anxious inquiries of the human soul but creeds are binding says one of course they are if we believe them to be the truth and are truthful ourselves in the acceptance and use of them but how are creeds binding erroneous evil creeds bring the souls who hold them into bondage we understand this but what about true and good creeds it appears to us that these give liberty aye the largest liberty jesus says ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free who says in the light of this statement that the truth of christ adopted in a creed tends to bondage godstruth dear reader is binding on you and on us all according to our convictions of it what freedom do you desire that which will give you indulgence in perpetual scepticism unsettlement in regard to anything call you this liberty we regard it as about the worst of bondage because we are thus in uncertainty we have no permanent habitation in godslove and life we have indeed the poor liberty of an outcast but not that of a child at home this last is a liberty which a creed embracing christian truth will allow us we want no greater it will help us in all our interpretations of god and his works and ways in the universe which is open before us two considerations then we may bear in mind one is that of the reasonableness and propriety of christian creeds this indiscriminate denunciation of them is not wise it is one of the flurries of the present age but will not endure the long run of theological investigation creeds may not all be written but they will exist even with those who denounce them the logic of fact and human experience effectually settles this so that a further superfluity of breath on this subject does not seem to be really needed a faith in the unseen that is most in accordance with nature human intuitions sound philosophy and the word of god is the one after which all souls may rightfully seek next of the universalist creed let us understand that it is not only a theological affirmation but a constant teacher of the most thorough virtue a call to the purest highest and most heavenly life the universalist church needs nothing so much as to be vitalized by its spirit the world needs nothing more than this vitality for its present salvation and this leads us to speak briefly of the true christian life which this church should seek to commend to the world here is the apostlesdirection which opens to us most clearly the practical influence of the faith of the gospel for the grace of god that bringeth salvation to all men hath appeared teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world it is the indwelling heavenly love the love which christianity is ever indicating and proving that will find its expression in the true christian believer it is the practical interpretation of that text from john we love him because he first loved us it is the faith with works proving its spiritual vitality it is at war with sin and wrong it comprehends the scriptural statement the fear of the lord is to hate evil and it realizes how evil is to be overcome and put away it aims to live here and now as it becomes the soul born of god to live soberly righteously godly what words more expressive of its life can be given they sum up the whole of the christian life this religion which the christian gospel recommends is reverential and worshipful the flippant inquiry of atheism of olden or modern time what is the almighty that we should pray to him or serve him it answers rationally and emphatically the lord he is god serve him with gladness for he is good his mercy is everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations worship is the natural utterance of the true believer as he looks upward to the father forms of worship are means by which his adoration finds expression monotony routine repetitions drony formality will not be in the offering for the reason that his whole soul is seeking god and finds the enjoyment of his holy presence and ineffable light this religion is affectional and emotional it is intellect awakened into love it is sober thought seeking most earnest expression it is logic on fire those who have no taste for the emotional in religion have only a partial conception of the most effective expression which the christian religion seeks and in which it may properly and profitably indulge the needy empty souled impulsive world masses are not to be reached and warmed uplifted and inspired by clearly exact and well stated and well worked out theological problems the multiplication table is true and useful but we do not look for any spiritual inspiration in it the religion that has most blessed the world is a religion that appeals to and draws out the affections that while it repudiates imprudent zeal and fanaticism insists on that earnestness which everywhere meets us in the new testament gospels and apostolic records and epistles which reaches menshearts and convinces them of their need of heavenly aid awakens the question asked by the converted soul lord what wilt thou have me to do and realizes the significance of those apostolic declarations be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody in your hearts unto god the lord giving thanks always for all things unto the father in the name of our lord jesus christ all this signifies living interest fervor of spirit emotional wakeful expression this religion is moreover eminently practical it is not only ready to say lord lord but to do the lordswork as well it forecloses this inconsiderate criticism sometimes heard why all this wordy demonstration and noise about religion good works are of a thousand times more avail the best religion is to do good true indeed and this is what christianity is constantly teaching no one taught it more forcibly than jesus himself the parable of the good samaritan is emphatic on this point that the reputed unbeliever who did good was worthy of more praise than the most punctilious professor of religion who was deficient in the essentials of the christian kingdom justice mercy and love what doth it profit though a man say he have faith and have not works can faith save him for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also but good works do not exclude these other manifestations of the true religion these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone once more this religion is reformatory and progressive reformation and progress are words always indicative of the christian dispensation with man the call to holiness and the response to it growth in godsgrace new achievements never resting in present attainments but ever striving with fresh inspiration for new accomplishments in the heavenly course most religions especially under the christian name have some of these characteristics but the religion nearest to that which christ taught and exemplified will have them all to secure the highest blessings of the christian kingdom the churches must be based on the principles and conform to the requirements of this kingdom the universalist church must its true prosperity has been and will be in accordance with its fidelity in this particular one of its earnest preachers of the present time has truly said opinions as faith will never serve to build up any christian character there is not a saved soul in any paradise anywhere which was ever saved by any opinion it is only when opinions become faith become rooted forces of the soul that they have any effect it should have the christian missionary inspiration and action should open its eyes to the magnitude and glory of the missionary outlook which no faith short of that of christian universalism presents to every lover of this humanity now groaning in bondage and waiting for the manifestation of the sons of god it should rise to a new and grander conception than has been realized by those who have borne to souls in the darkness of heathenism the limited doctrines of human wisdom go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature to no other church in christendom does this great text of the ages speak more explicitly than to the universalist it has the truth of the human brotherhood which all the world should understand and embrace for which all heathendom is waiting and to which in the long run it will come if this favored church is true to its heavenly calling that it may be thus true it is not to deceive itself with any false ideas of the leavening process which is to go on in other churches while it is inclined to do the least and not the most to keep the leaven in healthy and constant operation when rev otis a skinner was canvassing new england to raise the first one hundred thousand dollars for tufts college he was met with such suggestions as this from certain ones who professed friendliness to the success of his movements is it really necessary to make this attempt to build a new college why not keep quiet and wait until the time comes when harvard college will fall into our hands supposing such short sightedness and apathy had prevailed where would tufts college with all its benefits have been to day universalists should be about their own church missionary business it is theirs and no others are called upon to do it for them dr edward beecher in his records of the church in the third century many of whose members were avowed believers in the final reconciliation of all souls states that they were among the most zealous and devoted christians of that age in personal piety and in active missionary labors they sent out the gospel to the remotest shores of the then known world here is the same world to be reached by the messengers of this very gospel to day how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent no corner of the earth is exempt from the benefits of this message no means should be left unemployed to send it forth are universalists acquainted as they might be with the missionary work that has been already done by the other churches around them are they familiar with their reports and other publications involving the missionary enterprise showing what good they have accomplished in opening the christian scriptures and aiding a christian civilization in other lands do they realize that if these missionaries have propagated errors in theology they have cleared the way in part for a better dispensation of divine truth by the translations of the bible into other languages which they have made these are important considerations and universalists will do well to act upon them as the lord liveth the now open questions will one day be settled and settled on the side of the divine beneficence the love of god in christ has come into the world and will not go out of it until its work is here done love that is long suffering that rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth that beareth believeth hopeth and endureth all things and that never faileth love that will bring the last lost one home that will obliterate all the hells and people all the heavens in the universe these significant words of an advocate of universalism more than two centuries ago are in striking agreement with those of an advanced orthodox thinker of the present time it should never be forgotten that in the biblical philosophy of salvation the life of the individual is bound up with the life of the whole and reaches its fulness and completion only in the liberty for which the whole creation waits the orthodox theology of to day by rev newman smyth article in the
