 to conclude therefore let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety or an ill applied moderation think or maintain that a man can search too far or be too well studied in the book of god s word or in the book of god s works divinity or philosophy but rather let men endeavour an endless progress or proficience in both bacon advancement of learning contents introduction chapter variation under domestication causes of variability effects of habit correlation of growth inheritance character of domestic varieties difficulty of distinguishing between varieties and species origin of domestic varieties from one or more species domestic pigeons their differences and origin principle of selection anciently followed its effects methodical and unconscious selection unknown origin of our domestic productions circumstances favourable to man s power of selection chapter variation under nature variability individual differences doubtful species wide ranging much diffused and common species vary most species of the larger genera in any country vary more than the species of the smaller genera many of the species of the larger genera resemble varieties in being very closely but unequally related to each other and in having restricted ranges chapter struggle for existence bears on natural selection the term used in a wide sense geometrical powers of increase rapid increase of naturalised animals and plants nature of the checks to increase competition universal effects of climate protection from the number of individuals complex relations of all animals and plants throughout nature struggle for life most severe between individuals and varieties of the same species often severe between species of the same genus the relation of organism to organism the most important of all relations chapter natural selection natural selection its power compared with man s selection its power on characters of trifling importance its power at all ages and on both sexes sexual selection on the generality of intercrosses between individuals of the same species circumstances favourable and unfavourable to natural selection namely intercrossing isolation number of individuals slow action extinction caused by natural selection divergence of character related to the diversity of inhabitants of any small area and to naturalisation action of natural selection through divergence of character and extinction on the descendants from a common parent explains the grouping of all organic beings chapter laws of variation effects of external conditions use and disuse combined with natural selection organs of flight and of vision acclimatisation correlation of growth compensation and economy of growth false correlations multiple rudimentary and lowly organised structures variable parts developed in an unusual manner are highly variable specific characters more variable than generic secondary sexual characters variable species of the same genus vary in an analogous manner reversions to long lost characters summary chapter difficulties on theory difficulties on the theory of descent with modification transitions absence or rarity of transitional varieties transitions in habits of life diversified habits in the same species species with habits widely different from those of their allies organs of extreme perfection means of transition cases of difficulty natura non facit saltum organs of small importance organs not in all cases absolutely perfect the law of unity of type and of the conditions of existence embraced by the theory of natural selection chapter instinct instincts comparable with habits but different in their origin instincts graduated aphides and ants instincts variable domestic instincts their origin natural instincts of the cuckoo ostrich and parasitic bees slave making ants hive bee its cell making instinct difficulties on the theory of the natural selection of instincts neuter or sterile insects summary chapter hybridism distinction between the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids sterility various in degree not universal affected by close interbreeding removed by domestication laws governing the sterility of hybrids sterility not a special endowment but incidental on other differences causes of the sterility of first crosses and of hybrids parallelism between the effects of changed conditions of life and crossing fertility of varieties when crossed and of their mongrel offspring not universal hybrids and mongrels compared independently of their fertility summary chapter on the imperfection of the geological record on the absence of intermediate varieties at the present day on the nature of extinct intermediate varieties on their number on the vast lapse of time as inferred from the rate of deposition and of denudation on the poorness of our palaeontological collections on the intermittence of geological formations on the absence of intermediate varieties in any one formation on the sudden appearance of groups of species on their sudden appearance in the lowest known fossiliferous strata chapter on the geological succession of organic beings on the slow and successive appearance of new species on their different rates of change species once lost do not reappear groups of species follow the same general rules in their appearance and disappearance as do single species on extinction on simultaneous changes in the forms of life throughout the world on the affinities of extinct species to each other and to living species on the state of development of ancient forms on the succession of the same types within the same areas summary of preceding and present chapters chapter geographical distribution present distribution cannot be accounted for by differences in physical conditions importance of barriers affinity of the productions of the same continent centres of creation means of dispersal by changes of climate and of the level of the land and by occasional means dispersal during the glacial period co extensive with the world chapter geographical distribution continued distribution of fresh water productions on the inhabitants of oceanic islands absence of batrachians and of terrestrial mammals on the relation of the inhabitants of islands to those of the nearest mainland on colonisation from the nearest source with subsequent modification summary of the last and present chapters chapter mutual affinities of organic beings morphology embryology rudimentary organs classification groups subordinate to groups natural system rules and difficulties in classification explained on the theory of descent with modification classification of varieties descent always used in classification analogical or adaptive characters affinities general complex and radiating extinction separates and defines groups morphology between members of the same class between parts of the same individual embryology laws of explained by variations not supervening at an early age and being inherited at a corresponding age rudimentary organs their origin explained summary chapter recapitulation and conclusion recapitulation of the difficulties on the theory of natural selection recapitulation of the general and special circumstances in its favour causes of the general belief in the immutability of species how far the theory of natural selection may be extended effects of its adoption on the study of natural history concluding remarks international donations are gratefully accepted but we cannot make any statements
