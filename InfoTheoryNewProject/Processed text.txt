introductionthe koran admittedly occupies an important position among the great religiousbooks of the world though the youngest of the epoch making works belongingto this class of literature it yields to hardly any in the wonderful effectwhich it has produced on large masses of men it has created an all but newphase of human thought and a fresh type of character it first transformed anumber of heterogeneous desert tribes of the arabian peninsula into a nationof heroes and then proceeded to create the vast politico religiousorganisations of the muhammedan world which are one of the great forces withwhich europe and the east have to reckon to day the secret of the power exercised by the book of course lay in the mindwhich produced it it was in fact at first not a book but a strong livingvoice a kind of wild authoritative proclamation a series of admonitions promises threats and instructions addressed to turbulent and largelyhostile assemblies of untutored arabs as a book it was published after theprophet s death in muhammed s life time there were only disjointed notes speeches and the retentive memories of those who listened to them to speakof the koran is therefore practically the same as speaking of muhammed andin trying to appraise the religious value of the book one is at the same timeattempting to form an opinion of the prophet himself it would indeed bedifficult to find another case in which there is such a complete identitybetween the literary work and the mind of the man who produced it that widely different estimates have been formed of muhammed is well known to moslems he is of course the prophet par excellence and the koran isregarded by the orthodox as nothing less than the eternal utterance of allah the eulogy pronounced by carlyle on muhammed in heroes and hero worship willprobably be endorsed by not a few at the present day the extreme contraryopinion which in a fresh form has recently been revived by an able writer is hardly likely to find much lasting support the correct view very probablylies between the two extremes the relative value of any given system ofreligious thought must depend on the amount of truth which it embodies aswell as on the ethical standard which its adherents are bidden to follow another important test is the degree of originality that is to be assigned toit for it can manifestly only claim credit for that which is new in it notfor that which it borrowed from other systems with regard to the first named criterion there is a growing opinion amongstudents of religious history that muhammed may in a real sense be regardedas a prophet of certain truths though by no means of truth in the absolutemeaning of the term the shortcomings of the moral teaching contained in thekoran are striking enough if judged from the highest ethical standpoint withwhich we are acquainted but a much more favourable view is arrived at if acomparison is made between the ethics of the koran and the moral tenets ofarabian and other forms of heathenism which it supplanted the method followed by muhammed in the promulgation of the koran alsorequires to be treated with discrimination from the first flash of propheticinspiration which is clearly discernible in the earlier portions of the bookhe later on frequently descended to deliberate invention and artfulrhetoric he in fact accommodated his moral sense to the circumstances inwhich the r oc le he had to play involved him on the question of originality there can hardly be two opinions now that thekoran has been thoroughly compared with the christian and jewish traditionsof the time and it is besides some original arabian legends to those onlythat the book stands in any close relationship the matter is for the mostpart borrowed but the manner is all the prophet s own this is emphaticallya case in which originality consists not so much in the creation of newmaterials of thought as in the manner in which existing traditions of variouskinds are utilised and freshly blended to suit the special exigencies of theoccasion biblical reminiscences rabbinic legends christian traditionsmostly drawn from distorted apocryphal sources and native heathen stories all first pass through the prophet s fervid mind and thence issue in strangenew forms tinged with poetry and enthusiasm and well adapted to enforce hisown view of life and duty to serve as an encouragement to his faithfuladherents and to strike terror into the hearts of his opponents there is however apart from its religious value a more general view fromwhich the book should be considered the koran enjoys the distinction ofhaving been the starting point of a new literary and philosophical movementwhich has powerfully affected the finest and most cultivated minds among bothjews and christians in the middle ages this general progress of themuhammedan world has somehow been arrested but research has shown that whateuropean scholars knew of greek philosophy of mathematics astronomy andlike sciences for several centuries before the renaissance was roughlyspeaking all derived from latin treatises ultimately based on arabicoriginals and it was the koran which though indirectly gave the firstimpetus to these studies among the arabs and their allies linguisticinvestigations poetry and other branches of literature also made theirappearance soon after or simultaneously with the publication of the koran and the literary movement thus initiated has resulted in some of the finestproducts of genius and learning the style in which the koran is written requires some special attention inthis introduction the literary form is for the most part different fromanything else we know in its finest passages we indeed seem to hear a voiceakin to that of the ancient hebrew prophets but there is much in the bookwhich europeans usually regard as faulty the tendency to repetition which isan inherent characteristic of the semitic mind appears here in an exaggeratedform and there is in addition much in the koran which strikes us as wild andfantastic the most unfavourable criticism ever passed on muhammed s stylehas in fact been penned by the prophet s greatest british admirer carlylehimself and there are probably many now who find themselves in the samedilemma with that great writer the fault appears however to lie partly in our difficulty to appreciate thepsychology of the arab prophet we must in order to do him justice givefull consideration to his temperament and to the condition of things aroundhim we are here in touch with an untutored but fervent mind trying torealise itself and to assimilate certain great truths which have beenpowerfully borne in upon him in order to impart them in a convincing form tohis fellow tribesmen he is surrounded by obstacles of every kind yet hemanfully struggles on with the message that is within him learning he hasnone or next to none his chief objects of knowledge are floating storiesand traditions largely picked up from hearsay and his over wrought mind ishis only teacher the literary compositions to which he had ever listenedwere the half cultured yet often wildly powerful rhapsodies of early arabianminstrels akin to ossian rather than to anything else within our knowledge what wonder then that his koran took a form which to our colder temperamentssounds strange unbalanced and fantastic yet the moslems themselves consider the book the finest that ever appearedamong men they find no incongruity in the style to them the matter is alltrue and the manner all perfect their eastern temperament responds readilyto the crude strong and wild appeal which its cadences make to them andthe jingling rhyme in which the sentences of a discourse generally end addsto the charm of the whole the koran even if viewed from the point of viewof style alone was to them from the first nothing less than a miracle asgreat a miracle as ever was wrought but to return to our own view of the case our difficulty in appreciating thestyle of the koran even moderately is of course increased if instead ofthe original we have a translation before us but one is happy to be able tosay that rodwell s rendering is one of the best that have as yet beenproduced it seems to a great extent to carry with it the atmosphere in whichmuhammed lived and its sentences are imbued with the flavour of the east the quasi verse form with its unfettered and irregular rhythmic flow of thelines which has in suitable cases been adopted helps to bring out much ofthe wild charm of the arabic not the least among its recommendations is perhaps that it is scholarly without being pedantic that is to say that itaims at correctness without sacrificing the right effect of the whole toover insistence on small details another important merit of rodwell s edition is its chronological arrangementof the suras or chapters as he tells us himself in his preface it is now ina number of cases impossible to ascertain the exact occasion on which adiscourse or part of a discourse was delivered so that the system couldnot be carried through with entire consistency but the sequence adopted isin the main based on the best available historical and literary evidence andin following the order of the chapters as here printed the reader will beable to trace the development of the prophet s mind as

should be premised that their order as it stands in all arabicmanuscripts and in all hitherto printed editions whether arabic oreuropean is not chronological neither is there any authentic tradition toshew that it rests upon the authority of muhammad himself the scatteredfragments of the koran were in the first instance collected by his immediatesuccessor abu bekr about a year after the prophet s death at the suggestionof omar who foresaw that as the muslim warriors whose memories were thesole depositaries of large portions of the revelations died off or wereslain as had been the case with many in the battle of yemâma a h theloss of the greater part or even of the whole was imminent zaid ibnthâbit a native of medina and one of the ansars or helpers who had beenmuhammad s amanuensis was the person fixed upon to carry out the task andwe are told that he gathered together the fragments of the koran from everyquarter from date leaves and tablets of white stone and from the breastsof men the copy thus formed by zaid probably remained in the possession ofabu bekr during the remainder of his brief caliphate who committed it to thecustody of haphsa one of muhammad s widows and this text continued duringthe ten years of omar s caliphate to be the standard in the copies made fromit various readings naturally and necessarily sprung up and these underthe caliphate of othman led to such serious disputes between the faithful that it became necessary to interpose and in accordance with the warning ofhodzeifa to stop the people before they should differ regarding theirscriptures as did the jews and christians in accordance with this advice othman determined to establish a text which should be the sole standard andentrusted the redaction to the zaid already mentioned with whom heassociated as colleagues three according to others twelve of thekoreisch in order to secure the purity of that meccan idiom in whichmuhammad had spoken should any occasions arise in which the collators mighthave to decide upon various readings copies of the text formed were thusforwarded to several of the chief military stations in the new empire andall previously existing copies were committed to the flames zaid and his coadjutors however do not appear to have arranged thematerials which came into their hands upon any system more definite than thatof placing the longest and best known suras first immediately after thefatthah or opening chapter the eighth in this edition although even thisrule artless and unscientific as it is has not been adhered to withstrictness anything approaching to a chronological arrangement was entirelylost sight of late medina suras are often placed before early meccan suras the short suras at the end of the koran are its earliest portions while aswill be seen from the notes verses of meccan origin are to be found embeddedin medina suras and verses promulged at medina scattered up and down in themeccan suras it would seem as if zaid had to a great extent put hismaterials together just as they came to hand and often with entire disregardto continuity of subject and uniformity of style the text therefore ashitherto arranged necessarily assumes the form of a most unreadable andincongruous patchwork une assemblage says m kasimirski in his preface informe et incohérent de préceptes moraux religieux civils et politiques mêlés d exhortations de promesses et de menaces and conveys no ideawhatever of the development and growth of any plan in the mind of the founderof islam or of the circumstances by which he was surrounded and influenced it is true that the manner in which zaid contented himself with simplybringing together his materials and transcribing them without any attempt tomould them into shape or sequence and without any effort to supplyconnecting links between adjacent verses to fill up obvious chasms or tosuppress details of a nature discreditable to the founder of islam proveshis scrupulous honesty as a compiler as well as his reverence for the sacredtext and to a certain extent guarantees the genuineness and authenticity ofthe entire volume but it is deeply to be regretted that he did not combinesome measure of historical criticism with that simplicity and honesty ofpurpose which forbade him as it certainly did in any way to tamper with thesacred text to suppress contradictory and exclude or soften downinaccurate statements the arrangement of the suras in this translation is based partly upon thetraditions of the muhammadans themselves with reference especially to theancient chronological list printed by weil in his mohammed der prophet aswell as upon a careful consideration of the subject matter of each separatesura and its probable connection with the sequence of events in the life ofmuhammad great attention has been paid to this subject by dr weil in thework just mentioned by mr muir in his life of mahomet who also publishes achronological list of suras however of which he admits have not yet beencarefully fixed and especially by nöldeke in his geschichte des qôrans awork to which public honours were awarded in by the paris academy ofinscriptions from the arrangement of this author i see no reason to departin regard to the later suras it is based upon a searching criticism andminute analysis of the component verses of each and may be safely taken as astandard which ought not to be departed from without weighty reasons ihave however placed the earlier and more fragmentary suras after the twofirst in an order which has reference rather to their subject matter than topoints of historical allusion which in these suras are very few whilst onthe other hand they are mainly couched in the language of self communion ofaspirations after truth and of mental struggle are vivid pictures of heavenand hell or descriptions of natural objects and refer also largely to theopposition met with by muhammad from his townsmen of mecca at the outset ofhis public career this remark applies to what nöldeke terms the suras ofthe first period the contrast between the earlier middle and later suras is very strikingand interesting and will be at once apparent from the arrangement hereadopted in the suras as far as the th p we cannot but notice theentire predominance of the poetical element a deep appreciation as in suraxci p of the beauty of natural objects brief fragmentary andimpassioned utterances denunciations of woe and punishment expressed forthe most part in lines of extreme brevity with a change however in theposition of muhammad when he openly assumes the office of public warner the suras begin to assume a more prosaic and didactic tone though thepoetical ornament of rhyme is preserved throughout we gradually lose thepoet in the missionary aiming to convert the warm asserter of dogmatictruths the descriptions of natural objects of the judgment of heaven andhell make way for gradually increasing historical statements first fromjewish and subsequently from christian histories while in the surasrevealed at medina we no longer listen to vague words often as it wouldseem without positive aim but to the earnest disputant with the enemies ofhis faith the apostle pleading the cause of what he believes to be the truthof god he who at mecca is the admonisher and persuader at medina is thelegislator and the warrior who dictates obedience and uses other weaponsthan the pen of the poet and the scribe when business pressed as at medina poetry makes way for prose and although touches of the poetical elementoccasionally break forth and he has to defend himself up to a very lateperiod against the charge of being merely a poet yet this is rarely the casein the medina suras and we are startled by finding obedience to god and theapostle god s gifts and the apostle s god s pleasure and the apostle s spoken of in the same breath and epithets and attributes elsewhere appliedto allah openly applied to himself as in sura ix the suras viewed as a whole strike me as being the work of one who beganhis career as a thoughtful enquirer after truth and an earnest asserter ofit in such rhetorical and poetical forms as he deemed most likely to win andattract his countrymen and who gradually proceeded from the dogmatic teacherto the politic founder of a system for which laws and regulations had to beprovided as occasions arose and of all the suras it must be remarked thatthey were intended not for readers but for hearers that they were allpromulgated by public recital and that much was left as the imperfectsentences shew to the manner and suggestive action of the reciter it wouldbe impossible and indeed it is unnecessary to attempt a detailed life ofmuhammad within the narrow limits of a preface the main events thereof withwhich the suras of the koran stand in connection are the visions of gabriel seen or said to have been seen at the outset of his career in his thyear during one of his seasons of annual monthly retirement for devotionand meditation to mount hirâ near mecca the period of mental depression andre assurance previous to the assumption of the office of public teacher

no great difficulty in ascertaining the suras whichstand in connection with the more salient features of muhammad s life it isa much more arduous and often impracticable task to point out the preciseevents to which individual verses refer and out of which they sprung it isquite possible that muhammad himself in a later period of his career designedly mixed up later with earlier revelations in the same suras not forthe sake of producing that mysterious style which seems so pleasing to themind of those who value truth least when it is most clear and obvious but forthe purpose of softening down some of the earlier statements which representthe last hour and awful judgment as imminent and thus leading his followersto continue still in the attitude of expectation and to see in his latersuccesses the truth of his earlier predictions if after thoughts of thiskind are to be traced and they will often strike the attentive reader itthen follows that the perplexed state of the text in individual suras is tobe considered as due to muhammad himself and we are furnished with a seriesof constant hints for attaining to chronological accuracy and it may beremarked in passing that a belief that the end of all things was at hand may have tended to promote the earlier successes of islam at mecca as itunquestionably was an argument with the apostles to flee from the wrath tocome it must be borne in mind that the allusions to contemporary minorevents and to the local efforts made by the new religion to gain theascendant are very few and often couched in terms so vague and general thatwe are forced to interpret the koran solely by the koran itself and forthis the frequent repetitions of the same histories and the same sentiments afford much facility and the peculiar manner in which the details of eachhistory are increased by fresh traits at each recurrence enables us to tracetheir growth in the author s mind and to ascertain the manner in which apart of the koran was composed the absence of the historical element fromthe koran as regards the details of muhammad s daily life may be judged ofby the fact that only two of his contemporaries are mentioned in the entirevolume and that muhammad s name occurs but five times although he is allthe way through addressed by the angel gabriel as the recipient of the divinerevelations with the word say perhaps such passages as sura ii p and v p and the constant mention of guidance direction wandering may have been suggested by reminiscences of his mercantilejourneys in his earlier years it may be considered quite certain that it was not customary to reduce towriting any traditions concerning muhammad himself for at least the greaterpart of a century they rested entirely on the memory of those who havehanded them down and must necessarily have been coloured by their prejudicesand convictions to say nothing of the tendency to the formation of myths andto actual fabrication which early shews itself especially ininterpretations of the koran to subserve the purposes of the contendingfactions of the ommeyads and abbâsides it was under the th caliph al mâmûn that three writers mentioned below on whom we mainly depend for allreally reliable information flourished and even their writings arenecessarily coloured by the theological tendencies of their master andpatron who was a decided partizan of the divine right of ali and of hisdescendants the incidents mentioned in the koran itself for theinterpretation of which early tradition is available are comparatively few and there are many passages with which it is totally at variance as forinstance that muhammad worked miracles which the koran expressly disclaims traditions can never be considered as at all reliable unless they aretraceable to some common origin have descended to us by independentwitnesses and correspond with the statements of the koran itself always ofcourse deducting such texts as which is not unfrequently the case havethemselves given rise to the tradition it soon becomes obvious to the readerof muslim traditions and commentators that both miracles and historicalevents have been invented for the sake of expounding a dark and perplexingtext and that even the earlier traditions are largely tinged with themythical element the first biographer of muhammad of whom we have any information was zohri who died a h aged but his works though abundantly quoted by laterwriters are no longer extant much of his information was derived from orwa who died a h and was a near relative of ayesha the prophet s favouritewife ibn ishaq who died in a h and who had been a hearer of zohri composeda biography of muhammad for the use of the caliph al mánsûr on this work considerable remains of which have come down to us ibn hisham who died a h based his life of muhammad waquidi of medina who died a h composed a biographical work which hasreached us in an abbreviated form through his secretary katib it iscomposed entirely of traditions tabari the livy of the arabians gibbon n who died at baghdada h composed annals of muhammad s life and of the progress of islam these ancient writers are the principal sources whence anything likeauthentic information as to the life of muhammad has been derived and it maybe safely concluded that after the diligent investigations carried on by theprofessed collectors of traditions in the second century after the hejira that little or nothing remains to be added to our stores of informationrelative to the details of muhammad s life or to facts which may furtherillustrate the text of the koran but however this may be no records whichare posterior in date to these authorities can be considered as at alldeserving of dependance to consider says dr sprenger late historianslike abulfeda as authorities and to suppose that an account gains incertainty because it is mentioned by several of them is highly uncritical life of mohammad p the sources whence muhammad derived the materials of his koran are over andabove the more poetical parts which are his own creation the legends of histime and country jewish traditions based upon the talmud or perverted tosuit his own purposes and the floating christian traditions of arabia and ofs syria at a later period of his career no one would venture to doubt thedivine origin of the entire book but at its commencement the case wasdifferent the people of mecca spoke openly and tauntingly of it as the workof a poet as a collection of antiquated or fabulous legends or as palpablesorcery they accused him of having confederates and even specifiedforeigners who had been his coadjutors such were salman the persian to whomhe may have owed the descriptions of heaven and hell which are analogous tothose of the zendavesta and the christian monk sergius or as themuhammadans term him boheira from the latter and perhaps from otherchristians especially slaves naturalised at mecca muhammad obtained accessto the teaching of the apocryphal gospels and to many popular traditions ofwhich those gospels are the concrete expression his wife chadijah as wellas her cousin waraka a reputed convert to christianity and muhammad sintimate friend are said to have been well acquainted with the doctrines andsacred books both of jews and christians and not only were several arabtribes in the neighbourhood of mecca converts to the christian faith but ontwo occasions muhammad had travelled with his uncle abu talib as far asbostra where he must have had opportunities of learning the general outlinesof oriental christian doctrine and perhaps of witnessing the ceremonial oftheir worship and it appears tolerably certain that previous to and at theperiod of his entering into public life there was a large number ofenquirers at mecca who like zaid omayah of taief waraka etc weredissatisfied equally with the religion of their fathers the judaism and thechristianity which they saw around them and were anxiously enquiring forsome better way the names and details of the lives of twelve of the companions of muhammad who lived in mecca medina and taief are recorded who previous to his assumption of the prophetic office called themselveshanyfs i e converts puritans and were believers in one god and regardedabraham as the founder of their religion muhammad publicly acknowledged thathe was a hanyf and this sect of the hanyfites who are in no way to beconfounded with the later sect of the same name were among his meccanprecursors see n pp their history is to be found in the fihrist ms paris anc fonds nr and in other treatises which dr sprengerbelieves to have been in the library of the caliph el mâmûn in thistreatise the hanyfs are termed sabeites and said to have received thevolumes sohof or books of abraham mentioned in sura lxxxvii p which most commentators affirm to have been borrowed from them as isalso the case with the latter part of sura liii ad f p so thatfrom these books muhammad derived the legends of ad and themoud whosedownfall recent as it was see note p he throws back to a periodprevious to that of moses who is made to ask sura xiv p whethertheir history had reached his hearers muhammad is said to have discoveredthese books to be a recent forgery and that this is the reason why nomention of them occurs after the fourth year of his prophetic function a d hence too possibly the title hanyf was so soon dropped and exchangedfor that of muslim one who surrenders or resigns himself to god the warakaabove mentioned and cousin of chadijah is said to have believed on muhammadas long as he continued true to the principles of the hanyfs but to havequitted him in disgust at his subsequent proceedings and to have died anorthodox christian it has been supposed that muhammad derived many of his notions concerningchristianity from gnosticism and that it is to the numerous gnostic sectsthe koran alludes when it reproaches the christians with having split uptheir religion into parties but for muhammad thus to have confoundedgnosticism with christianity itself its prevalence in arabia must have beenfar more universal than we have any reason to believe it really was in fact we have no historical authority for supposing that the doctrines of theseheretics were taught or professed in arabia at all it is certain on theother hand that the basilidans valentinians and other gnostic sects hadeither died out or been reabsorbed into the orthodox church towards themiddle of the fifth century and had disappeared from egypt before the sixth it is nevertheless possible that the gnostic doctrine concerning thecrucifixion was adopted by muhammad as likely to reconcile the jews to islam as a religion embracing both judaism and christianity if they might believethat jesus had not been put to death and thus find the stumbling block ofthe atonement removed out of their path the jews would in this case havesimply been called upon to believe in jesus as being what the koranrepresents him a holy teacher who like the patriarch enoch or the prophetelijah had been miraculously taken from the earth but in all otherrespects the sober and matter of fact statements of the koran relative tothe family and history of jesus are altogether opposed to the wild andfantastic doctrines of gnostic emanations and especially to the manner inwhich they supposed jesus at his baptism to have been brought into unionwith a higher nature it is quite clear that muhammad borrowed in severalpoints from the doctrines of the ebionites essenes and sabeites epiphanius h r x describes the notions of the ebionites of nabath a moabitis andbasanitis with regard to adam and jesus almost in the very words of suraiii he tells us that they observed circumcision were opposed tocelibacy forbad turning to the sunrise but enjoined jerusalem as theirkebla as did muhammad during twelve years that they prescribed as did thesabeites washings very similar to those enjoined in the koran and allowedoaths by certain natural objects as clouds signs of the zodiac oil thewinds etc which we find adopted in the koran these points of contactwith islam knowing as we do muhammad s eclecticism can hardly beaccidental we have no evidence that muhammad had access to the christian scriptures though it is just possible that fragments of the old or new testament mayhave reached him through chadijah or waraka or other meccan christians possessing mss of the sacred volume there is but one direct quotation suraxxi in the whole koran from the scriptures and though there are a fewpassages as where alms are said to be given to be seen of men and as noneforgiveth sins but god only which might seem to be identical with texts ofthe new testament yet this similarity is probably merely accidental it is however curious to compare such passages as deut xxvi peter v with sura xxiv p and x p john vii with the illiterate prophet matt xxiv and john xii with the use of theword hour as meaning any judgment or crisis and the last judgment the voiceof the son of god which the dead are to hear with the exterminating orawakening cry of gabriel etc the passages of this kind with which thekoran abounds result from muhammad s general acquaintance with scripturalphraseology partly through the popular legends partly from personalintercourse with jews and christians and we may be quite certain thatwhatever materials muhammad may have derived from our scriptures directly orindirectly were carefully recast he did not even use its words without dueconsideration for instance except in the phrase the lord of the worlds he seems carefully to have avoided the expression the lord probably becauseit was applied by the christians to christ or to god the father it should also be borne in mind that we have no traces of the existence ofarabic versions of the old or new testament previous to the time of muhammad the passage of st jerome hæc autem translatio nullum de veteribus sequiturinterpretem sed ex ipso hebraico arabicoque sermone et interdum syro nuncverba nunc sensum nunc simul utrumque resonabit prol gal obviouslydoes not refer to versions but to idiom the earliest ar version of the oldtestament of which we have any knowledge is that of r saadias gaon a d and the oldest ar version of the new testament

multis locis facta esset vernacula if indeed inthese comparatively late versions the general phraseology especially in thehistories common to the scriptures and to the koran bore any similarity toeach other and if the orthography of the proper names had been the same ineach it might have been fair to suppose that such versions had been made more or less upon the basis of others which though now lost existed inthe ages prior to muhammad and influenced if they did not directly form his sources of information but this does not appear to be the case thephraseology of our existing versions is not that of the koran and theseversions appear to have been made from the septuagint the vulgate syriac coptic and greek the four gospels says tischendorf originem mixtam haberevidentur from the arab jews muhammad would be enabled to derive an abundant thoughmost distorted knowledge of the scripture histories the secrecy in which hereceived his instructions from them and from his christian informants enabled him boldly to declare to the ignorant pagan meccans that god hadrevealed those biblical histories to him but there can be no doubt from theconstant identity between the talmudic perversions of scripture histories andrabbinic moral precepts that the rabbins of the hejaz communicated theirlegends to muhammad and it should be remembered that the talmud wascompleted a century previous to the era of muhammad and cannot fail to haveextensively influenced the religious creed of all the jews of the arabianpeninsula in one passage muhammad speaks of an individual jew perhaps someone of note among his professed followers as a witness to his mission andthere can be no doubt that his relations with the jews were at one time those of friendship and intimacy when we find him speak of their recognisinghim as they do their own children and hear him blaming their most colloquialexpressions it is impossible however for us at this distance of time topenetrate the mystery in which this subject is involved yet certain it is that although their testimony against muhammad was speedily silenced thekoreisch knew enough of his private history to disbelieve and to disprove hispretensions of being the recipient of a divine revelation and that theyaccused him of writing from the dictation of teachers morning and evening and it is equally certain that all the information received by muhammad wasembellished and recast in his own mind and with his own words there is aunity of thought a directness and simplicity of purpose a peculiar andlaboured style a uniformity of diction coupled with a certain deficiency ofimaginative power which proves the ayats signs or verses of the koran atleast to be the product of a single pen the longer narratives were probably elaborated in his leisure hours while the shorter verses eachclaiming to be a sign or miracle were promulgated as occasion required them and whatever muhammad may himself profess in the koran as to hisignorance even of reading and writing and however strongly modernmuhammadans may insist upon the same point an assertion by the waycontradicted by many good authors there can be no doubt that to assimilateand work up his materials to fashion them into elaborate suras to fit themfor public recital must have been a work requiring much time study andmeditation and presumes a far greater degree of general culture than anyorthodox muslim will be disposed to admit in close connection with the above remarks stands the question of muhammad ssincerity and honesty of purpose in coming forward as a messenger from god for if he was indeed the illiterate person the muslims represent him to havebeen then it will be hard to escape their inference that the koran is asthey assert it to be a standing miracle but if on the other hand it was abook carefully concocted from various sources and with much extraneous aid and published as a divine oracle then it would seem that the author is atonce open to the charge of the grossest imposture and even of impiousblasphemy the evidence rather shews that in all he did and wrote muhammadwas actuated by a sincere desire to deliver his countrymen from the grossnessof its debasing idolatries that he was urged on by an intense desire toproclaim that great truth of the unity of the godhead which had taken fullpossession of his own soul that the end to be attained justified to his mindthe means he adopted in the production of his suras that he worked himself upinto a belief that he had received a divine call and that he was carried onby the force of circumstances and by gradually increasing successes tobelieve himself the accredited messenger of heaven the earnestness of thoseconvictions which at mecca sustained him under persecution and which perhapsled him at any price as it were and by any means not even excluding deceitand falsehood to endeavour to rescue his countrymen from idolatry naturallystiffened at medina into tyranny and unscrupulous violence at the same time he was probably more or less throughout his whole career the victim of acertain amount of self deception a cataleptic subject from his earlyyouth born according to the traditions of a highly nervous and excitablemother he would be peculiarly liable to morbid and fantastic hallucinations and alternations of excitement and depression which would win for him inthe eyes of his ignorant countrymen the credit of being inspired it wouldbe easy for him to persuade himself that he was the seal of the prophets the proclaimer of a doctrine of the divine unity held and taught by thepatriarchs especially by abraham a doctrine that should present to mankindjudaism divested of its mosaic ceremonial and christianity divested of theatonement and the trinity doctrine as he might have believed fitted anddestined to absorb judaism christianity and idolatry and this persuasion once admitted into his mind as a conviction retained possession of it andcarried him on though often in the use of means towards the end of hiscareer far different from those with which he commenced it to a victoriousconsummation it is true that the state of arabia previous to the time ofmuhammad was one of preparedness for a new religion that the scatteredelements were there and wanted only the mind of a master to harmonise andenforce them and that islam was so to speak a necessity of the time still muhammad s career is a wonderful instance of the force and life thatresides in him who possesses an intense faith in god and in the unseen world and whatever deductions may be made and they are many and serious from thenoble and truthful in his character he will always be regarded as one ofthose who have had that influence over the faith morals and whole earthlylife of their fellow men which none but a really great man ever did or can exercise and as one of those whose efforts to propagate some great veritywill prosper in spite of manifold personal errors and defects both ofprinciple and character the more insight we obtain from undoubted historical sources into theactual character of muhammad the less reason do we find to justify thestrong vituperative language poured out upon his head by maracci prideaux and others in recent days one of whom has found in the byzantine maometis the number of the beast rev xii it is nearer to the truth tosay that he was a great though imperfect character an earnest thoughmistaken teacher and that many of his mistakes and imperfections were theresult of circumstances of temperament and constitution and that theremust be elements both of truth and goodness in the system of which he was themain author to account for the world wide phenomenon that whatever may bethe intellectual inferiority if such is indeed the fact of the muslimraces the influence of his teaching aided it is true by the vast impulsegiven to it by the victorious arms of his followers has now lasted fornearly thirteen centuries and embraces more than one hundred millions of ourrace more than one tenth part of the inhabitants of the globe it must be acknowledged too that the koran deserves the highest praise forits conceptions of the divine nature in reference to the attributes ofpower knowledge and universal providence and unity that its belief andtrust in the one god of heaven and earth is deep and fervent and that thoughit contains fantastic visions and legends teaches a childish ceremonial andjustifies bloodshedding persecution slavery and polygamy yet that at thesame time it embodies much of a noble and deep moral earnestness andsententious oracular wisdom and has proved that there are elements in it onwhich mighty nations and conquering though not perhaps durable empires canbe built up it is due to the koran that the occupants in the sixth centuryof an arid peninsula whose poverty was only equalled by their ignorance become not only the fervent and sincere votaries of a new creed but likeamru and many more its warlike propagators impelled possibly by drought andfamine actuated partly by desire of conquest partly by religiousconvictions they had conquered persia in the seventh century the northerncoasts of africa and a large portion of spain in the eighth the punjaub andnearly the whole of india in the ninth the simple shepherds and wanderingbedouins of arabia are transformed as if by a magician s wand into thefounders of empires the builders of cities the collectors of more librariesthan they at first destroyed while cities like fostât baghdad cordova anddelhi attest the power at which christian europe trembled and thus whilethe koran which underlays this vast energy and contains the principles whichare its springs of action reflects to a great extent the mixed character ofits author its merits as a code of laws and as a system of religiousteaching must always be estimated by the changes which it introduced intothe customs and beliefs of those who willingly or by compulsion embraced it in the suppression of their idolatries in the substitution of the worship ofallah for that of the powers of nature and genii with him in the abolitionof child murder in the extinction of manifold superstitious usages in thereduction of the number of wives to a fixed standard it was to the arabiansan unquestionable blessing and an accession though not in the christiansense a revelation of truth and while every christian must deplore theoverthrow of so many flourishing eastern churches by the arms of thevictorious muslims it must not be forgotten that europe in the middle ages owed much of her knowledge of dialectic philosophy of medicine andarchitecture to arabian writers and that muslims formed the connecting linkbetween the west and the east for the importation of numerous articles ofluxury and use that an immense mass of fable and silly legend has been builtup upon the basis of the koran is beyond a doubt but for this muhammad isnot answerable any more than he is for the wild and bloodthirsty excesses ofhis followers in after ages i agree with sale in thinking that howcriminal soever muhammad may have been in imposing a false religion onmankind the praises due to his real virtues ought not to be denied him preface and venture to think that no one can rise from the perusal of hiskoran without argeeing with that motto from st augustin which sale hasprefixed to

xxiv xlvii twice ii x but it is not easy todetermine whether it means a whole chapter or part only of a chapter or isused in the sense of revelation see weil s mohammed der prophet pp it is understood by the muhammadan commentators to have a primaryreference to the succession of subjects or parts like the rows of bricks ina wall the titles of the suras are generally taken from some word occurringin each which is printed in large type throughout where practicable this formula bismillahi rrahmani rrahim is of jewish origin it was inthe first instance taught to the koreisch by omayah of taief the poet whowas a contemporary with but somewhat older than muhammad and who duringhis mercantile journeys into arabia petr a and syria had made himselfacquainted with the sacred books and doctrines of jews and christians kitabal aghâni delhi muhammad adopted and constantly used it and it isprefixed to each sura except the ninth the former of the two epithetsimplies that the mercy of god is exercised as occasions arise towards allhis creatures the latter that the quality of mercy is inherent in god andpermanent so that there is only a shade of difference between the two words maracci well renders in nomine dei miseratoris misericordis the renderingi have adopted is that of mr lane in his extracts from the koran see alsofreytag s lex ii p perhaps in the name of allah the god of mercy the merciful would more fully express the original arabic the first fiveverses of this sura are in the opinion of nearly all commentators ancientand modern the earliest revelations made to muhammad in the th year ofhis life and the starting point of el islam see the authorities quoted indetail in nöldeke s geschichte des qorâns p n the usual rendering is read but the word qaraa which is the root of theword koran analogous to the rabbinic mikra rather means to address recite and with regard to its etymology and use in the kindred dialects to call cryaloud proclaim compare isai lviii kings xviii and gesen thesaur on the hebrew root i understand this passage to mean preach tothy fellow men what thou believest to be true of thy lord who has created manfrom the meanest materials and can in like manner prosper the truth whichthou proclaimest he has taught man the art of writing recently introducedat mecca and in this thou wilt find a powerful help for propagating theknowledge of the divine unity the speaker in this as in all the suras isgabriel of whom muhammad had as he believed a vision on the mountain hirâ near mecca see note on the next page the details of the vision are quiteunhistorical this and the following verses may have been added at a later period though previous to the flight and with special reference if we are tobelieve the commentators beidhawi etc to the opposition which muhammadexperienced at the hands of his opponent abu jahl who had threatened to sethis foot on the prophet s neck when prostrate in prayer but the wholepassage admits of application to mankind in general that is muhammad nöldeke however proposes to render a slave and it iscertain that the doctrines of islam were in the first instance embraced byslaves many of whom had been carried away from christian homes or born ofchristian parents at mecca men of this description says dr sprenger life of mohammad allahabad p no doubt prepared the way for theislam by inculcating purer notions respecting god upon their masters andtheir brethren these men saw in mohammad their liberator and beingsuperstitious enough to consider his fits as the consequence of aninspiration they were among the first who acknowledged him as a prophet many of them suffered torture for their faith in him and two of them died asmartyrs the excitement among the slaves when mohammad first assumed hisoffice was so great that abd allah bin jod an who had one hundred of thesesufferers found it necessary to remove them from makkah lest they shouldall turn converts see sura xvi ii lit hast thou seen if he be upon the guidance the principal men of the koreisch who adhered to abu jahl during a period variously estimated from six months to three years from therevelation of this sura or of its earliest verses the prophetic inspirationand the revelation of fresh suras is said to have been suspended thisinterval is called the fatrah or intermission and the meccan suras deliveredat its close show that at or during this period muhammad had gained anincreasing and more intimate acquaintance with the jewish and christianscriptures the accounts however says mr muir vol ii arethroughout confused if not contradictory and we can only gather withcertainty that there was a time during which his mind hung in suspense anddoubted the divine mission the idea of any supernatural influence is ofcourse to be entirely excluded although there is no doubt that muhammadhimself had a full belief in the personality and influence of satans anddjinn profound meditation the struggles of an earnest mind anxious toattain to truth the morbid excitability of an epileptic subject visionsseen in epileptic swoons disgust at meccan idolatry and a desire to teachhis countrymen the divine unity will sufficiently account for the period ofindecision termed the fatrah and for the determination which led muhammad in all sincerity but still self deceived to take upon himself the officeand work of a messenger from god we may perhaps infer from such passages assura ii what had ever been the leading idea in muhammad s mind sura lxxiv the enwrapped ii mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulo thou enwrapped in thy mantle arise and warn thy lord magnify him thy raiment purify it the abomination flee it and bestow not favours that thou mayest receive again with increase and for thy lord wait thou patiently for when there shall be a trump on the trumpet that shall be a distressful day a day to the infidels devoid of ease leave me alone to deal with him whom i have created and on whom i have bestowed vast riches and sons dwelling before him and for whom i have smoothed all things smoothly down yet desireth he that i should add more but no because to our signs he is a foei will lay grievous woes upon him for he plotted and he planned may he be cursed how he planned again may he be cursed how he planned then looked he around him then frowned and scowled then turned his back and swelled with disdain and said this is merely magic that will be wrought it is merely the word of a mortal we will surely cast him into hell fire and who shall teach thee what hell fire is it leaveth nought it spareth nought blackening the skin over it are nineteen angels none but angels have we made guardians of the fire nor have we made this tobe their number but to perplex the unbelievers and that they who possess thescriptures may be certain of the truth of the koran and that they whobelieve may increase their faith and that they to whom the scriptures have been given and the believers maynot doubt and that the infirm of heart and the unbelievers may say what meaneth god bythis parable thus god misleadeth whom he will and whom he will doth he guide aright andnone knoweth the armies of thy lord but himself and this is no other than awarning to mankind nay by the moon by the night when it retreateth by the morn when it brighteneth hell is one of the most grievous woes fraught with warning to man to him among you who desireth to press forward or to remain behind for its own works lieth every soul in pledge but they of god s right handin their gardens shall ask of the wicked what hath cast you into hell fire they will say we were not of those who prayed and we were not of those who fed the poor and we plunged into vain disputes with vain disputers and we rejected as a lie the day of reckoning till the certainty came upon us and intercession of the interceders shall not avail them then what hath come to them that they turn aside from the warningas if they were affrighted asses fleeing from a lion and every one of them would fain have open pages given to him out of heaven it shall not be they fear not the life to come it shall not be for this koran is warning enough and whoso will itwarneth him but not unless god please shall they be warned meet is he to be feared meet is forgiveness in him this sura is placed by muir in the second stage of meccan suras andtwenty first in chronological order in the third or fourth year of theprophet s career according however to the chronological list of surasgiven by weil leben m p from ancient tradition as well as from theconsentient voice of tradionists and commentaries v nöld geschichte p sprenger s life of mohammad p it was the next revealed after thefatrah and the designation to the prophetic office the main features ofthe tradition are that muhammad while wandering about in the hills nearmecca distracted by doubts and by anxiety after truth had a vision of theangel gabriel seated on a throne between heaven and earth that he ran to hiswife chadijah in the greatest alarm and desired her perhaps fromsuperstitious motives and believing that if covered with clothes he shouldbe shielded from the glances of evil spirits comp stanley on i cor xi to envelope him in his mantle that then gabriel came down and addressed himas in v i this vision like that which preceded sura xcvi may actuallyhave occurred during the hallucinations of one of the epileptic fits fromwhich muhammad from early youth appears to have suffered hence muhammad insura lxxxi appeals to it as a matter of fact and such he doubtless believeit to be it may here be observed that however absurd the muslim traditionsmay be in many of their details it will generally be found that where thereis an ancient and tolerably universal consent there will be found at thebottom a residuum of fact and historical truth at the same time there canbe no doubt but that the details of the traditions are too commonly foundedupon the attempt to explain or to throw light upon a dark passage of thekoran and are pure inventions of a later age the arabic words are not those used in later suras to express the sameidea said to be walid b mogheira a person of note among the unbelievingmeccans this portion of the sura seems to be of a different date from thefirst seven verses though very ancient and the change of subject is similarto that at v of the previous sura this and the three following verses wear the appearance of having beeninserted at a later period to meet objections respecting the number of theangels who guard hell raised by the jews perhaps at medina as the fourclasses of persons specified are those whom muhammad had to deal with in thatcity viz the jews believers the hypocrites or undecided and idolaters these are constantly mentioned together in the medina suras that is who believe and do not believe as the word sakar disturbs the rhyme it may have been inserted by amistake of

the koran prayer and future punishment from the similarity of the tradition withregard to its having been preceded by a vision of gabriel beidh etc itseems to belong to or at least to describe a

remembers that judaism was extensivelynaturalised in arabia and christianity also although to a smaller extent the words and phrases of these religions were doubtless familiar to themeccans especially

last and muir sixth in the earliest classof meccan suras must at least have been composed prior to sura xxxvii where it is quoted and to sura xv which refers to it and it canscarcely be an accidental circumstance that the words of the first second and fifth verses do not occur in any other suras of the first meccan periodas given by n ldeke but frequently in those of the second which ittherefore in n ldeke opinion immediately precedes but this may beaccounted for by its having been recast for the purposes of private andpublic devotion by muhammad himself which is the meaning probably of themuhammadan tradition that it was revealed twice it should also be observedthat including the auspicatory formula there are the same number ofpetitions in this sura as in the lord s prayer it is recited several timesin each of the five daily prayers and on many other occassions as inconcluding a bargain etc it is termed the opening of the book thecompletion the sufficing sura the sura of

in allusion to the meaning of abu lahab father of flame sura cviii the abundance xii mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifultruly we have given thee an abundance pray therefore to the lord and slay the victims verily whoso hateth thee shall be childless a reply to those who had taunted muhammad with the death of his sons as amark of the divine displeasure sura civ the backbiter xii mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulwoe to every backbiter defamer who amasseth wealth and storeth it against the future he thinketh surely that his wealth shall be with him for ever nay for verily he shall be flung into the crushing fire and who shall teach thee what the crushing fire is it is god s kindled fire which shall mount above the hearts of the damned it shall verily rise over them like a vault on outstretched columns sura cvii religion xiv mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulwhat thinkest thou of him who treateth our religion as a lie he it is who trusteth away the orphan and stirreth not others up to feed the poor woe to those who pray but in their prayer are careless who make a shew of devotion but refuse help to the needy sura cii desire xv mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulthe desire of increasing riches occupieth you till ye come to the grave nay but in the end ye shall knownay once more in the end ye shall know your folly nay would that ye knew it with knowledge of certainty surely ye shall see hell fire then shall ye surely see it with the eye of certainty then shall ye on that day be taken to task concerning pleasures sura xcii the night xvi mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulby the night when she spreads her veil by the day when it brightly shineth by him who made male and female at different ends truly do ye aim but as to him who giveth alms and feareth god and yieldeth assent to the good to him will we make easy the path to happiness but as to him who is covetous and bent on riches and calleth the good a lie to him will we make easy the path to misery and what shall his wealth avail him when he goeth down truly man s guidance is with usand our s the future and the past i warn you therefore of the flaming fire none shall be cast to it but the most wretched who hath called the truth a lie and turned his back but the god fearing shall escape it who giveth away his substance that he may become pure and who offereth not favours to any one for the sake of recompense but only as seeking the face of his lord the most high and surely in the end he shall be well content see pref p line i comp luke xi muhammad perhaps derived this view of the meritoriousanture of almsgiving from the jewish oral law sura lxviii the pen xvii mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulnun by the pen and by what they write thou o prophet by the grace of thy lord art not possessed and truly a boundless recompense doth await thee for thou art of a noble nature but thou shalt see and they shall see which of you is the demented now thy lord well knoweth he the man who erreth from his path and well dothhe know those who have yielded to guidance give not place therefore to those who treat thee as a liar they desire thee to deal smoothly with them then would they be smooth as oilwith thee but yield not to the man of oaths a despicable person defamer going about with slander hinderer of the good transgressor criminal harsh beside this impure by birth though a man of riches and blessed with sons who when our wondrous verses are recited to him saith fables of theancients we will brand him on the nostrils verily we have proved them the meccans as we proved the owners of thegarden when they swore that at morn they would cut its fruits but added no reserve wherefore an encircling desolation from thy lord swept round it while theyslumbered and in the morning it was like a garden whose fruits had all been cut then at dawn they called to each other go out early to your field if ye would cut your dates so on they went whispering to each other no poor man shall set foot this day within your garden and they went out at daybreak with this settled purpose but when they beheld it they said truly we have been in fault yes we are forbidden our fruits the most rightminded of them said did i not say to you will ye not givepraise to god they said glory to our lord truly we have done amiss and they fell to blaming one another they said oh woe to us we have indeed transgressed haply our lord will give us in exchange a better garden than this verily wecrave it of our lord such hath been our chastisement but heavier shall be the chastisement of thenext world ah did they but know it verily for the god fearing are gardens of delight in the presence of theirlord shall we then deal with those who have surrendered themselves to god as withthose who offend him what hath befallen you that ye thus judge have ye a scripture wherein ye can search outthat ye shall have the things ye choose or have ye received oaths which shall bind us even until the day of theresurrection that ye shall have what yourselves judge right ask them which of them will guarantee this or is it that they have joined gods with god let them produce thoseassociate gods of theirs if they speak truth on the day when men s legs shall be bared and they shall be called upon tobow in adoration they shall not be able their looks shall be downcast shame shall cover them because while yet insafety they were invited to bow in worship but would not obey leave me alone therefore with him who chargeth this revelation withimposture we will lead them by degrees to their ruin by ways which theyknow not yet will i bear long with them for my plan is sure askest thou any recompense from them but they are burdened with debt are the secret things within their ken do they copy them from the book ofgod patiently then await the judgment of thy lord and be not like him who was inthe fish when in deep distress he cried to god had not favour from his lord reached him cast forth would he have been onthe naked shore overwhelmed with shame but his lord chose him and made him of the just almost would the infidels strike thee down with their very looks when theyhear the warning of the koran and they say he is certainly possessed yet is it nothing less than a warning for all creatures it has been conjectured that as the word nun means fish there may be areference to the fish which swallowed jonas v the fact however isthat the meaning of this and of the similar symbols throughout the koran was unknown to the muhammadans themselves even in the first century possiblythe letters ha mim which are prefixed to numerous successive suras wereprivate marks or initial letters attached by their proprietor to the copiesfurnished to said when effecting his recension of the text under othman inthe same way the letters prefixed to other suras may be monograms orabbreviations or initial letters of the names of the persons to whom thecopies of the respective suras belonged addenda the symbol nun may possibly refer to this letter as forming therhyme in most of the verses of this sura this sura has been supposed by ancient muslim authorities to be if not theoldest the second revelation and to have followed sura xcvi but thisopinion probably originated from the expression in v compared with suraxcvi verses read like a later addition and this passage as wellas verse has been classed with the medina revelations in the absenceof any reliable criterion for fixing the date i have placed this sura withthose which detail the opposition encountered by the prophet at mecca by djinn comp sur xxxiv in bearing the taunts of the unbelievers with patience they did not add the restriction if god will an expression implying a grievous calamity borrowed probably from theaction of stripping previous to wrestling swimming

on which thou dost dwell or by sire and offspring surely in trouble have we created man what thinketh he that no one hath power over him i have wasted saith he enormous riches what thinketh he that no one regardeth him what have we not made him eyes and tongue and lips and guided him to the two highways yet he attempted not the steep and who shall teach thee what the steep is it is to ransom the captive or to feed in the day of famine the orphan who is near of kin or the poor that lieth in the dust beside this to be of those who believe and enjoin stedfastness on eachother and enjoin compassion on each other these shall be the people of the right hand while they who disbelieve our signs shall be the people of the left around them the fire shall close lit and begetter and what he hath begotten of good and evil thus we read in hilchoth matt noth aniim c the ransoming of captivestakes precedence of the feeding and clothing of the poor and there is nocommandment so great as this sura cv the elephant xix mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulhast thou not seen how thy lord dealt with the army of the elephant did he not cause their stratagem to miscarry and he sent against them birds in flocks ababils claystones did they hurl down upon them and he made them like stubble eaten down this sura is probably muhammad s appeal to the meccans intended at thesame time for his own encouragement on the ground of their deliverance fromthe army of abraha the christian king of abyssinia and arabia felix said tohave been lost in the year of muhammad s birth in an expedition against meccafor the purpose of destroying the caaba this army was cut off by small pox wakidi hishami and there is no doubt as the arabic word for small poxalso means small stones in reference to the hard gravelly feeling of thepustules what is the true interpretation of the fourth line of this sura which like many other poetical passages in the koran has formed thestarting point

cleansed but as to him who cometh to thee in earnest and full of fears him dost thou neglect nay but it the koran is a warning and whoso is willing beareth it in mind written on honoured pages exalted purified by the hands of scribes honoured righteous cursed be man what hath made him unbelieving of what thing did god create him out of moist germs he created him and fashioned him then made him an easy passage from the womb then causeth him to die and burieth him then when he pleaseth will raise him again to life aye but man hath not yet fulfilled the bidding of his lord let man look at his food it was we who rained down the copious rains then cleft the earth with clefts and caused the upgrowth of the grain and grapes and healing herbs and the olive and the palm and enclosed gardens

interrupted by the blindabdallah ibn omm maktûm who asked to hear the koran the prophet spoke veryroughly to him at the time but afterwards repented and treated him everafter with the greatest respect so much so that he twice made him governorof medina that is if he does not embrace islam and so become pure from sin thouwilt not be to blame thou art simply charged with the delivery of a messageof

hidden and we will make easy to thee our easy ways warn therefore for the warning is profitable he that feareth god will receive the warning and the most reprobate only will turn aside from it who shall be exposed to the terrible fire in which he shall not die and shall not live happy he who is purified by islam and who remembereth the name of his lord and prayeth but ye prefer this present

together during which thou mightest have seen the people laid low as though they hadbeen the trunks of hollow palms and couldst thou have seen one of them surviving pharaoh also and those who flourished before him and the overthrown cities committed sin and disobeyed the sent one of their lord therefore did he chastise them withan accumulated chastisement when the flood rose high we bare you in the ark that we might make that event a warning to you and that the retaining earmight retain it but when one blast shall be blown on the trumpet and the earth and the mountains shall be

perished from me lay ye hold on him and chain him then at the hell fire burn him then into a chain whose length is seventy cubits thrust him for he believed not in god the great and was not careful to

this verily is the word of an apostle worthy of all honour and that it is not the word of a poet how little do ye believe neither is it the word of a soothsayer kahin how little do ye receivewarning it is a missive from the lord of the worlds but if muhammad had fabricated concerning us any sayings we had surely seized him by the right hand and had cut through the vein of his neck nor would we have withheld any one of you from him but verily it the koran is a warning for the god fearing and we well know that there are of you who treat it as a falsehood but it shall be the despair of

from the truth is turned from it by a divine decree perish the liars who are bewildered in the depths of ignorance they ask when this day of judgment on that day they shall be tormented at the fire taste ye of this your torment whose speedy coming ye challenged but the god fearing shall dwell amid gardens and fountains enjoying what their lord hath given them because aforetime they were well doers but little of the night was it that they slept and at dawn they prayed for pardon and gave due share of their wealth to the suppliant and the outcast on earth are signs for men of firm belief

smote her face and said what i old andbarren they said thus saith thy lord he truly is the wise the knowing said he and what o messengers is your errand they said to a wicked people are we sent to hurl upon them stones of clay destined by thy lord for men guilty of excesses and we brought forth the believers who were in the city but we found not in it but one family of muslims and signs we left in it for those who dread the afflictive chastisement and in moses when we sent him to pharaoh with manifest power but relying on his forces he turned his back and said sorcerer orpossessed so we seized him and his hosts and cast them into the sea for of all blamewas he worthy and in ad when we sent against them the desolating blast it touched not aught over which it came but it turned it to dust and in themoud when it was said to them enjoy yourselves for yet awhile but they rebelled against their lord s command so the tempest took them asthey watched its coming they were not able to stand upright and could not help themselves and we destroyed the people of noah before them for an impious people werethey and the heaven with our hands have we built it up and given it its expanse

heinous sin and were wont to say what after we have died and become dust and bones shall we be raised and our fathers the men of yore say aye the former and the latter gathered shall they all be for

this is the honourable koran written in the preserved book let none touch it but the purified it is a revelation from the lord of the worlds such tidings as these will ye disdain will ye make it your

truth as a lie our servant didthey charge with falsehood and said demoniac and he was rejected then cried he to his lord verily they prevail against me come thoutherefore to my succour so we opened the gates of heaven with water which fell in torrents and we caused the earth to break forth with springs and their waters met bysettled decree and we bare him on a vessel made with planks and nails under our eyes it floated on a recompence to him who had been rejected withunbelief and we left it a sign but is there any one who receives the warning and how great was my vengeance and my menace easy for warning have we made the koran but is there any one who receivesthe warning the adites called the truth a lie but how great was my vengeance and mymenace for we sent against them a roaring wind in a day of continued distress it tore men away as though they were uprooted palm stumps and how great was my vengeance and my menace easy for warning have we made the koran but is there any one who receivesthe warning the tribe of themoud treated the threatenings as lies and they said shall we follow a single man from among ourselves thenverily should we be in error and in folly to him alone among us is the office of warning entrusted no he is animpostor an insolent person to morrow shall they learn who is the impostor the insolent for we will send the she camel to prove them do thou mark them well osaleh and be patient and foretell them that their waters shall be divided between themselves andher and that every draught shall come by turns to them but they called to their comrade and he took a knife and ham strung her and how great was my vengeance and my menance we sent against them a single shout and they became like the dry sticks ofthe fold builders easy have we made the koran for warning but is there any one who receivesthe warning the people of lot treated his warning as a lie but we sent a stone charged wind against them all except the family of lot whom at daybreak we delivered by our special grace for thus we reward the thankful he indeed had warned them of our severity but of that warning theydoubted even this guess did they demand therefore we deprived them of sight and said taste ye my vengeance and my menace and in the morning a relentless punishment overtook them easy have we made the koran for warning but is there any one who receivesthe warning to the people of pharaoh also came the threatenings all our miracles did they treat as impostures therefore seized we them as heonly can seize who is the mighty the strong are your infidels o meccans better men than these is there an exemptionfor you in the sacred books will they say we are a host that lend one another aid the host shall be routed and they shall turn them back but that hour is their threatened time and that hour shall be most severeand bitter verily the wicked are sunk in bewilderment and folly on that day they shall be dragged into the fire on their faces taste ye thetouch of hell all things have we created after a fixed decree our command was but one word swift as the twinkling of an eye of old too have we destroyed the like of you yet is any one warned and everything that they do is in the books each action both small and great is written down verily amid gardens and rivers shall the pious dwell in the seat of truth in the presence of the potent king see sura lvi xxvi also sura lxxxvii vii kept by the guardian angels the talmudic descriptions of the gardens for the later jews believed inmore than one paradise and of the rivers and trees therein will be found inschr der talm rabb judenthum pp sura xxxvii the ranks l mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulby the angels ranged in order for songs of praise and by those who repel demons and by those who recite the koran for warning truly your god is but one lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them andlord of the east we have adorned the lower heaven with the adornment of the stars they serve also as a guard against every rebellious satan that they overhear not what passeth in the assembly on high for they aredarted at from every side driven off and consigned to a lasting torment while if one steal a word by stealth a glistening flame pursueth him ask the meccans then are they or the angels whom we have made the strongercreation aye of coarse clay have we created them but while thou marvellest they mock when they are warned no warning do they take and when they see a sign they fall to mocking and say this is no other than clear sorcery what when dead and turned to dust and bones shall we indeed be raised our sires also of olden times say yes and ye shall be covered with disgrace for one blast only and lo they shall gaze around them and shall say oh woe to us this is the day of reckoning this is the day of decision which yegainsaid as an untruth gather together those who have acted unjustly and their consorts and thegods whom they adoredbeside god and guide them to the road for hell set them forth they shall be questioned how now that ye help not one another but on this day they shall submit themselves to god and shall address one another with mutual reproaches they shall say in sooth ye came to us in well omened sort but they will answer nay it was ye who would not believe and we had nopower whatever over you nay ye were people given to transgress just therefore is the doom which our lord hath passed upon us we shallsurely taste it we made you err for we had erred ourselves partners therefore shall they be in punishment on that day truly thus will we deal with the wicked because when it was said to them there is no god but god they swelled withpride and said shall we then abandon our gods for a crazed poet nay he cometh with truth and confirmeth the sent ones of old ye shall surely taste the painful punishment and ye shall not be rewarded but as ye have wrought save the sincere servants of god a stated banquet shall they haveof fruits and honoured shall they bein the gardens of delight upon couches face to face a cup shall be borne round among them from a fountain limpid delicious to those who drink it shall not oppress the sense nor shall they therewith be drunken and with them are the large eyed ones with modest refraining glances fairlike the sheltered egg and they shall address one another with mutual questions saith one of them i truly had a bosom friend who said art thou of those who credit it what when we shall have died and become dust and bones shall we indeed bejudged he shall say to those around him will ye look and he shall look and see him in the midst of hell and he shall say to him by god thou hadst almost caused me to perish and but for the favour of my lord i had surely been of those who have beenbrought with thee into torment but do we not die say the blessed any other than our first death and have we escaped the torment this truly is the great felicity for the like of this should the travailers travail is this the better repast or the tree ez zakkoum verily we have made it for a subject of discord to the wicked it is a tree which cometh up from the bottom of hell its fruits is as it were the heads of satans and lo the damned shall surely eat of it and fill their bellies with it then shall they have thereon a mixture of boiling water then shall they return to hell they found their fathers erring and they hastened on in their footsteps also before them the greater number of the ancients had erred though we had sent warners among them but see what was the end of these warned ones except of god s true servants noah called on us of old and right prompt were we to hear him and we saved him and his family out of the great distress and we made his offspring the survivors and we left for him with posterity peace be on noah throughout the worlds thus do we reward the well doers for he was one of our believing servants and the rest we drowned and truly of his faith was abraham when he brought to his lord a perfect heart when he said to his father and to his people what is this ye worship prefer ye with falsehood gods to god and what deem ye of the lord of the worlds so gazing he gazed towards the stars and said in sooth i am ill and they turned their back on him and departed he went aside to their gods and said do ye not eat what aileth you that ye do not speak he broke out upon them with the right hand striking when his tribesmen came back to him with hasty stepshe said worship ye what ye carve when god hath created you and that ye make they said build up a pyre for him and cast him into the glowing flame fain would they plot against him but we brought them low and he said verily i repair to my lord who will guide me o lord give me a son of the righteous we announced to him a youth of meekness and when he became a full grown youth his father said to him my son i have seen in a dream that i shouldsacrifice thee therefore consider what thou seest right he said my father do what thou art bidden of the patient ifgod please shalt thou find me and when they had surrendered them to the will of god he laid him down uponhis forehead we cried unto him o abraham now hast thou satisfied the vision see how we recompense the righteous this was indeed a decisive test and we ransomed his son with a costly victim and we left this for him among posterity peace be on abraham thus do we reward the well doers for he was of our believing servants and we announced isaac to him a righteous prophet and on him and on isaac we bestowed our blessing and among their offspringwere well doers and others to their own hurt undoubted sinners and of old to moses and to aaron shewed we favours and both of them and their people we rescued from the great distress and we succoured them and they became the conquerors and we gave them moses and aaron each the lucid book and we guided them each into the right way and we left this for each among posterity peace be on moses and aaron thus do we reward the well doers for they were two of our believing servants and elias truly was of our sent ones when he said to his people fear ye not god invoke ye baal and forsake ye the most skilful creator god is your lord and the lord of your sires of old but they treated him as a liar and shall therefore be consigned topunishment except god s faithful servants and we left this for him among posterity peace be on eliasin thus do we reward the well doers for he was one of our believing servants and lot truly was of our sent ones when we rescued him and all his family save an aged woman among those who tarried afterward we destroyed the others and ye indeed pass by their ruined dwellings at mornand night will ye not then reflect jonas too was one of the apostles when he fled unto the laden ship and lots were cast and he was doomed and the fish swallowed him for he was blameworthy but had he not been of those who praise us in its belly had he surely remained till the day of resurrection and we cast him on the bare shore and he was sick and we caused a gourd plant to grow up over him and we sent him to a hundred thousand persons or even more and because they believed we continued their enjoyments for a season inquire then of the meccans whether thy lord hath daughters and they sons have we created the angels females and did they witness it is it not a falsehood of their own devising when they say god hath begotten they are indeed liars would he have preferred daughters to sons what reason have ye for thus judging will ye not then receive this warning have ye a clear proof for them produce your book if ye speak truth and they make him to be of kin with the djinn but the djinn have long knownthat these idolaters shall be brought up before god far be the glory of god from what they impute to him his faithful servants do not thus moreover ye and what ye worshipshall not stir up any against god save him who shall burn in hell and verily each one of us hath his appointed place and we range ourselves in order and we celebrate his praises and if those infidels say had we a revelation transmitted to us from those of old we had surely been god s faithful servants yet they believe not the koran but they shall know its truth at last our word came of old to our servants the apostles that they should surely be the succoured and that our armies should procure the victory for them turn aside therefore from them for a time and behold them for they too shall in the end behold their doom would they then hasten our vengeance but when it shall come down into their courts an evil morning shall it be tothose who have had their warning turn aside from them therefore for a time and behold for they too shall in the end behold their doom far be the glory of thy lord the lord of all greatness from what theyimpute to him and peace be on his apostles and praise be to god the lord of the worlds i have

he maketh alive and killeth your lord and the lordof your sires of old yet with doubts do they disport them but mark them on the day when the heaven shall give out a palpable smoke which shall enshroud mankind this will be an afflictive torment they will cry our lord relieve us from this torment see we arebelievers but how did warning avail them when an undoubted apostle had come to them and they turned their backs on him and said taught by others possessed were we to relieve you from the plague even a little ye would certainlyrelapse on the day when we shall fiercely put forth our great fierceness we willsurely take vengeance on them of old before their time had we proved the people of pharaoh when a nobleapostle presented himself to them send away with me cried he the servants

leave behind you the cleft sea they are a drowned host how many a garden and fountain did they quit and corn fields and noble dwellings and pleasures in which they rejoiced them so was it and we gave them as a heritage to another people nor heaven nor earth wept for them nor was their sentence respited and we rescued the children of israel from a degrading affliction from pharaoh for he was haughty given to excess and we chose them in our prescience above all peoples and we shewed them miracles wherein was their clear trial yet these infidels say there is but our first death neither shall we be raised again bring back our sires if ye be men of truth are they better than the people of tobba and those who flourished before them whom we destroyed for their evil deeds we have not

understand my speech and give me a counsellor from among my family aaron my brother by him gird up my loins and make him a colleague in my work that we may praise thee oft and oft remember thee for thou regardest us he said o moses thou hast obtained thy suit already at another time have we showed thee favour when we spake unto thy mother what was spoken cast him into the ark then cast him on

revealed to us that chastisement shall be on him whochargeth with falsehood and turneth him away and he said who is your lord o moses he said our lord is he who hath given to everything its form and thenguideth it aright but what said he was the state of generations past he said the knowledge thereof is with my lord in the book of his decrees my lord erreth not nor forgetteth he hath spread the earth as a bed and hath traced out paths for you therein and hath sent down rain from heaven and by it we bring forth the kinds ofvarious herbs eat ye and feed your cattle of a truth in this are signs

falsehoods andrefused to believe he said hast thou come o moses to drive us from our land by thineenchantments therefore will we assuredly confront thee with like enchantments so appointa meeting between us and you we will not fail it we and do not thou in aplace alike for both he said on the feast day be your meeting and in broad daylight let thepeople be assembled and pharaoh turned away and collected his craftsmen and came said moses to them woe to you devise not a lie against god for then will he destroy you by a punishment they who have lied have everperished and the magicians discussed their plan and spake apart in secret they said these two are surely sorcerers fain would they drive you fromyour land by their sorceries and lead away in their paths your chiefest men so muster your craft then come in order well this day shall it be for him who shall gain the upper hand they said o moses wilt thou first cast down thy rod or shall we be thefirst who cast he said yes cast ye down first and lo by their enchantment their cordsand rods seemed to him as if they ran and moses conceived a secret fear within him we said fear not for thou shalt be the uppermost cast forth then what is in thy right hand it shall swallow up what they haveproduced they have only produced the deceit of an enchanter and come wherehe may ill shall an enchanter fare and the magicians fell down and worshipped they said we believe in the lord of aaron and of moses said pharaoh believe ye on him ere i give you leave he in sooth is yourmaster who hath taught you magic i will therefore cut

sea fear not thou to be overtaken neither be thou afraid and pharaoh followed them with his hosts and the whelming billows of the seaoverwhelmed them for pharaoh misled his people and did not guide them o children of israel we rescued you from your foes and we appointed ameeting with you on the right side of the mountain and we caused the mannaand the quail to descend upon you eat said we of the good things with which we have supplied you butwithout excess lest my wrath fall upon you for on whom my wrath doth fall he perisheth outright surely however will i forgive him who turneth to god and believeth andworketh righteousness and then yieldeth to guidance but what hath hastened thee on apart from thy people o moses he said they are hard on my footsteps but to thee o lord have ihastened that thou mightest be well pleased with me he said of a truth now have we proved thy people since thou didst leavethem and samiri had led them astray and moses returned to his people angered sorrowful he said o my people did not your lord promise you a good promise was thetime of my absence long to you or desired ye that wrath from your lordshould light upon you that ye failed in your promise to me they said not of our own accord have we failed in the promise to thee butwe were made to bring loads of the people s trinkets and we threw them intothe fire and samiri likewise cast them in and brought forth to them acorporeal lowing calf and they said this is your god and the god ofmoses whom he hath forgotten what saw they not that it returned them no answer and could neither hurtnor help them and aaron had before said to them o my people by this calf are ye onlyproved surely your lord is the god of mercy follow me therefore and obey mybidding they said we will not cease devotion to it till moses come back to us he said o aaron when thou sawest that they had gone astray what hinderedthee from following me hast thou then disobeyed my command he said o son of my mother seize me not by my beard nor by my head indeed i feared lest thou shouldst say thou hast rent the children of isreal asunder and hast not observed myorders he said and what was thy motive o samiri he said i saw what they sawnot so i took a handful of dust from the track of the messenger of god and flung it into the calf for so my soul prompted me he said begone then verily thy doom even in this life shall be to say touch me not and there is a threat against thee which thou shalt notescape hereafter now look at thy god to which thou hast continued sodevoted we will surely burn it and reduce it to ashes which we will castinto the sea your god is god beside whom there is no god in his knowledge he embracethall things thus do we recite to thee histories of what passed of old and from ourselfhave we given thee admonition whoso shall turn aside from it shall verily carry a burden on the day ofresurrection under it shall they remain and grievous in the day of resurrection shallit be to them to bear on that day there shall be a blast on the trumpet and we will gather thewicked together on that day with leaden eyes they shall say in a low voice one to another ye tarried but ten days onearth we are most knowing with respect to that which they will say when the mostveracious of them will say ye have not tarried above a day and they will ask thee of the mountains say scattering my lord will scatterthem in dust and he will leave them a level plain thou shalt see in it no hollows orjutting hills on that day shall men follow their summoner he marcheth straight on andlow shall be their voices before the god of mercy nor shalt thou hear aughtbut the light footfall no intercession shall avail on that day save his whom the god of mercy shallallow to intercede and whose words he shall approve he knoweth their future and their past but in their own knowledge theycomprehend it not and humble shall be their faces before him that liveth the self subsisting and undone he who shall bear the burden of iniquity but he who shall have done the things that are right and is a believer shallfear neither wrong nor loss thus have we sent down to thee an arabic koran and have set forth menacestherein diversely that haply they may fear god or that it may give birth toreflection in them exalted then be god the king the truth be not hasty in its recital whilethe revelation of it to thee is incomplete say rather o my lord increaseknowledge unto me and of old we made a covenant with adam but he forgat it and we found nofirmness of purpose in him and when we said to the angels fall down and worship adam they worshippedall save eblis who refused and we said o adam this truly is a foe tothee and to thy wife let him not therefore drive you out of the garden andye become wretched for to thee is it granted that thou shalt not hunger therein neither shaltthou be naked but satan whispered him said he o adam shall i shew thee the tree ofeternity and the kingdom that faileth not and they both ate thereof and their nakedness appeared to them and theybegan to sew of the leaves of the garden to cover them and adam disobeyedhis lord and went astray afterwards his lord chose him for himself and was turned towards him andguided him and god said get ye all down hence the one of you a foe unto the other hereafter shall guidance come unto you from me and whoso followeth my guidance shall not err and shall not be wretched but whoso turneth away from my monition his truly shall be a life of misery and we will assemble him with others on the day of resurrection blind he will say o my lord why hast thou assembled me with others blind whereas i was endowed with sight he will answer thus is it because our signs came unto thee and thou didstforget them and thus shalt thou be forgotten this day even thus will we recompense him who hath transgressed and hath not believedin the signs of his lord and assuredly the chastisement of the next worldwill be more severe and more lasting are not they who walk the very places where they dwelt aware how manygenerations we have destroyed before them verily in this are signs to men ofinsight and had not a decree of respite from thy lord first gone forth theirchastisement had at once ensued yet the time is fixed put up then with what they say and celebrate the praise of thy lord beforethe sunrise and before its setting and some time in the night do thoupraise him and in the extremes of the day that thou haply mayest pleasehim and strain not thine eye after what we have bestowed on divers of them thebraveries of this world that we may thereby prove them the portion which thylord will give is better and more lasting enjoin prayer on thy family and persevere therein we ask not of thee tofind thine own provision we will provide for thee and a happy issue shallthere be to piety but they say if he come not to us with a sign from his lord buthave not clear proofs for the koran come to them in what is in the books ofold and had we destroyed them by a chastisement before its time they wouldsurely have said o our lord how could we believe if thou didst not sendunto us an apostle that we might follow thy signs ere that we were humbledand disgraced say each one of us awaiteth the end wait ye then and ye shall know whichof us have been followers of the even way and who hath been the rightlyguided the first or

the people of pharaoh what will they not fear me he said my lord in sooth i fear lest they treat me as a liar and my breast is straitened and i am slow of speech send therefore toaaron to be my helpmate for they have a charge against me and i fear lest they put me to death he said surely not go ye therefore with our signs we will be with you andwill hearken and go to pharaoh and say verily we are the messengers of the lord of theworlds send forth with us the children of israel he said did we not rear thee among us when a child and hast thou notpassed years of thy life among us and yet what a deed is that which thou hast done thou art one of theungrateful he said i did it indeed and i was one of those who erred and i fled fromyou because i feared you but my lord hath given me wisdom and hath made meone of his apostles and is this the favour thou hast conferred on me that thou hast enslaved thechildren of israel said pharaoh who then is the lord of the worlds he said the lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is betweenthem if only ye believe it said pharaoh to those around him hear ye this your lord said moses and the lord of your sires of old in sooth your apostle whom he hath sent to you said pharaoh iscertainly possessed he said lord is he of the east and of the west and of all that is betweenthem if ye can understand he said if ye take any god beside me i will surely put thee in ward said moses what if i shew thee that which shall be a proof of my mission he said forth with it then if thou speakest truth then threw he down his staff and lo an undoubted serpent and he drew out his hand and lo it was white to the beholders he said to his nobles around him this truly is a right cunning sorcerer fain would he drive you out of your land by his sorcery but what do yesuggest they said put him and his brother off awhile and send summoners to all thecities who shall bring to thee every cunning magician so the magicians were mustered at a set

lord of the worlds the lord of moses and of aaron said pharaoh have ye then believed on him ere i gave you leave he truly isyour master who hath taught you magic but bye and bye ye shall surely knowmy power i will cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides and i will have you allcrucified they said it cannot harm us for to our lord shall we return assuredly we trust that our lord will forgive us our sins since we are ofthe first who believe then revealed we this order to moses go forth by night with my servants for ye will be pursued and pharaoh sent summoners through the cities these israelites said they are a scanty band yet are they enraged against us but we truly are numerous wary thus we caused them to quit gardens and fountains and treasures and splendid dwellings so was it and we gave them to the children of israel for an heritage then at sunrise the egyptians followed them and when the hosts came in view of one another the comrades of moses said we are surely overtaken he said by no means for my lord is with me he will guide me and we revealed this order to moses strike the sea with thy rod and itclave asunder and each part became like a huge mountain then made we the others to draw on and we saved moses and those who were with him all but we drowned the others truly in this was a sign but most of them did not believe but verily thy lord he is the mighty the merciful and recite to them the story of abrahamwhen he said to his father and to his people what worship ye they said we worship idols and constant is our devotion to them he said can they hear you when ye cry to them or help you or do you harm they said but we found our fathers do the like he said how think ye they whom ye worship ye and your fathers of early days are my foes but not so the lord of the worlds who hath created me and guideth me who giveth me food and drink and when i am sick he healeth me and who will cause me to die and again quicken me and who i hope will forgive me my sins in the day of reckoning my lord bestow on me wisdom and join me to the just and give me a good name among posterity and make me one of the heirs of the garden of delight and forgive my father for he was one of the erring and put me not to shame on the day when mankind shall be raised up the day when neither wealth nor children shall avail save to him who shall come to god with a sound heart when paradise shall be brought near the pious and hell shall lay open for those who have gone astray and it shall be said to them where are they whom ye worshippedbeside god can they harm you or help themselves and they shall be cast into it the seducers and the seduced and all the host of eblis they shall say as they wrangle therein together by god we were in a plain error when we equalled you with the lord of the worlds and none misled us but the wicked and we have none to plead for us nor friend who careth for us could we but return we would be of the believers verily in this was a sign but most of them believed not and truly thy lord he is the mighty the merciful the people of noah gainsaid the apostles when their brother noah said to them will ye not fear god of a truth am i your faithful apostle fear god then and obey me i ask of you no reward for this for my reward is of the lord of the worldsalone fear god then and obey me they said shall we believe on thee when the meanest only are thyfollowers he said but i have no knowledge of that they did to my lord only must their account be given would that ye understood this and i will not thrust away those who believe for i am only one charged with plain warnings they said now unless thou desist o noah one of the stoned shalt thousurely be he said lord my people treat me as a liar decide thou therefore a decision between me and them and rescue me and thefaithful who are with me so we saved him and those who were with him in the fully laden ark and afterwards we drowned the rest herein truly was a sign but most of them

god then and obey me i ask for no reward for this for my reward is of the lord of the worldsalone what build ye landmarks on all heights in mere pastime and raise ye structures to be your lasting

flocks and children and gardens and fountains indeed i fear for you the punishment of a tremendous day they said it is the same to us whether thou warn or warn us not this is but a tale of the ancients and we are not they who shall be punished and they charged him with imposture and we destroyed them in this was asign but most of them believed not but thy lord he is the mighty the merciful

for this my reward is of the lord of the worldsalone shall ye be left secure amid these things here amid gardens and fountains and corn fields and palm trees with flower sheathing branches and insolent that ye are will ye hew out your dwellings in the mountains but fear god and obey me and obey not the bidding of those who commit excess who act disorderly on the earth and reform it not they said certainly thou art a person bewitched thou art only a man like us produce now a sign if thou art a man of truth he said this she camel then drink shall there be for her and drink shallthere be for you on a several day for each but harm her not lest the punishment of a tremendous day overtake you but they ham strung her and repented of it on the morrow for the punishment overtook them in this truly was a sign but most of thembelieved not but thy lord he is the powerful the merciful the people of lot treated their apostles as liars when their brother lot said to them will ye not fear god i am your apostle worthy of all credit fear god then and obey me for this i ask you no reward my reward is of the lord of the worlds alone what with men of all creatures will ye have commerce and leave ye your wives whom your lord hath created for you ah ye are anerring people they said o lot if thou desist not one of the banished shalt thou surelybe he said i utterly abhor your doings my lord deliver me and my family from what they do so we delivered him and his whole family save an aged one among those who tarried then we destroyed the rest and we rained a rain upon them and fatal was the rain to those whom we hadwarned in this truly was a sign but most of them did not believe but thy lord he is the powerful the merciful the dwellers in the forest of madian treated the apostles as liars when shoaib their brother said to them will ye not fear god i truly am your trustworthy apostle fear god then and obey me no reward ask i of you for this my reward is of the lord of the worldsalone fill the measure and be not of those who minish weigh with exact balance and defraud not men in their substance and do no wrong on the earth by deedsof licence and fear him who made you and the races of old they said certainly thou art a person bewitched thou art but a man like us and we deem thee liar make now a part of the heaven to fall down upon us if thou art a man oftruth he said my lord best knoweth your doings and when they treated him as a liar the chastisement of the day of cloudovertook them this truly was the chastisement of a dreadful day in this was a sign but most of them believed not but thy lord he is the mighty the merciful verily from the lord of the worlds hath this book come down the faithful spirit hath come down with itupon thy heart that thou mightest become a warner in the clear arabic tongue and truly it is foretold in the scriptures of them of yore was it not a sign to them that the learned among the children of israelrecognised it if we had sent it down unto any foreigner and he had recited it to them they had not believed in such sort have we influenced the heart of the wicked ones that they will not believe it till they see the grievous chastisement and it shall come upon them on a sudden when they look not for it and they will say can we be respited what will they seek to hasten on our chastisement how thinkest thou if after we have given them their fill for years that with which they are menaced come upon them at last of what avail will their enjoyments be to them we never destroyed a city which had not first its warnerswith admonition nor did we deal unjustly the satans were not sent down with this koran it beseemed them not and they had not the power for they are far removed from hearing it call not thou on any other god but god lest thou be of those consigned totorment but warn thy relatives of nearer kin and kindly lower thy wing over the faithful who follow thee and if they disobey thee then say i will not be answerable for yourdoings and put thy trust in him that is the mighty the merciful who seeth thee when thou standest in prayer and thy demeanour amongst those who worship for he heareth knoweth all shall i tell you on whom satan descend they descend on every lying wicked person they impart what they have heard but most of them are liars it is the poets whom the erring follow seest thou not how they rove distraught in every valley and that they say that which they do not save those who believe and do good works and oft remember god and who defend themselves when unjustly treated

feeblenss of the style clearly point to a lateorigin they impart to their votaries on earth what they have learned by stealthand partially in heaven muhammad found it necessary to employ the pens of certain poets to defendhimself and his religion from the ridicule and satire of other poets whoseproductions were recited at the great annual fair held at okatz the olympusof the hejaz the poems which were judged the best were written up in lettersof gold or suspended hence called moallakat in the caaba these poeticalcontests were subsequently suppressed by muhammad as offering openings

thou not have come to us with the angels if thou wert of those whoassert the truth we will not send down the angels without due cause the infidels would notin that case have been respited verily we have sent down the warning and verily we will be its guardian and already have we sent apostles before thee among the sects of theancients but never came apostles to them whom they did not deride in like manner will we put it into the hearts of the sinners of mecca to dothe same they will not believe on him though the example of those of old hath gonebefore even were we to open above them a gate in heaven yet all the while they weremounting up to it they would surely say it is only that our eyes are drunken nay we are apeople enchanted we have set the signs of the zodiac in the heavens and adorned and deckedthem forth for the beholders and we guard them from every stoned satan save such as steal a hearing and him doth a visible flame pursue and the earth have we spread forth and thrown thereon the mountains andcaused everything to spring forth in it in balanced measure and we have provided therein sustenance for you and for the creatures whichnot ye sustain and no one thing is there but with us are its storehouses and we send itnot down but in settled measure and we send forth the fertilising winds and cause the rain to come down fromthe heaven and give you to drink of it and it is not ye who are itsstorers and we cause to live and we cause to die and we are the heir of all things we know those of you who flourish first and we know those who come later and truly thy lord will gather them together again for he is wise knowing we created man of dried clay of dark loam moulded and the djinn had we before created of subtle fire remember when thy lord said to the angels i create man of dried clay ofdark loam moulded and when i shall have fashioned him and breathed of my spirit into him thenfall ye down and worship him and the angels bowed down in worship all of them all together save eblis he refused to be with those who bowed in worship o eblis said god wherefore art thou not with those who bow down inworship he said it beseemeth not me to bow in worship to man whom thou hast createdof clay of moulded loam he said begone then hence thou art a stoned one and the curse shall be on thee till the day of reckoning he said o my lord respite me till the day when man shall be raised fromthe dead he said one then of the respited shalt thou betill the day of the predestined time he said o my lord because thou hast beguiled me i will surely make allfair seeming to them on the earth i will surely beguile them all except such of them as shall be thy sincere servants he said this is the right way with me for over none of my servants shalt thou have power save those beguiled oneswho shall follow thee and verily hell is the promise for them one and all it hath seven portals at each portal is a separate band of them but mid gardens and fountains shall the pious dwell enter ye therein in peace secure and all rancour will we remove from their bosoms they shall sit as brethren face to face on couches therein no weariness shall reach them nor forth from it

him and said peace verily said he we fear you they said fear not for of a sage son we bring thee tidings he said bring ye me such tidings now that old age hath come upon me what therefore are your tidings really they said we announce them to thee in very truth be not then one of thedespairing and who said he despaireth of the mercy of his lord but they who err he said what is your business then o ye sent ones they said we are sent unto a people who are sinners except the family of lot whom verily we will rescue all except his wife we have decreed that she shall be of those who linger and when the sent ones came to the family of lothe said yes are persons unknown to me they said yes but we have come to thee for a purpose about which thypeople doubt we have come to thee with very truth and we are truthful envoys lead forth therefore thy family in the dead of the night follow thou ontheir rear and let no one of you turn round but pass ye on whither ye arebidden and this command we gave him because to the last man should these people becut off at morning then came the people of the city rejoicing at the news he said these are my guests therefore disgrace me not and fear god and put me not to shame they said have we not forbidden thee to entertain any one whatever he said here are my daughters if ye will thus act as thou livest o muhammad they were bewildered in the drunkenness of theirlust so a tempest overtook them at their sunrise and we turned the city upside down and we rained stones of baked clay uponthem verily in this are signs for those who scan heedfully and these cities lay on the high road verily in this are signs for the faithful the inhabitants also of el aika were sinners so we took vengeance on them and they both became a plain example and the people of hedjr treated god s messengers as liars and we brought forth our signs to them but they drew back from them and they hewed them out abodes in the mountains to secure them but a tempest surprised them at early morn and their labours availed them nothing we have not created the heavens and the earth and all that between them is but for a worthy end and verily the hour shall surely come whereforedo thou muhammad forgive with kindly forgiveness for thy lord he is the creator the wise we have already given thee the seven verses of repetition and the gloriouskoran strain not thine eyes after the good things we have bestowed on some of theunbelievers afflict not thyself on their account and lower thy wing to thefaithful and say i am the only plain spoken warner we will punish those who foster divisions who break up the koran into parts by thy lord we will surely take account from them one and all concerning that which they have done profess publicly then what thou hast been bidden and withdraw from thosewho join gods to god verily we will maintain thy cause against those who deride thee who set up gods with god and at last shall they know their folly now know

god the compassionate the mercifulkaf ha ya ain sad a recital of thy lord s mercy to his servantzachariah when he called upon his lord with secret calling and said o lord verily my bones are weakened and the hoar hairs glistenon my head and never lord have i prayed to thee with ill success but now i have fears for my kindred after me and my wife is barren give me then a successor as thy special gift who shall be my heir and anheir of the family of jacob and make him lord well pleasing to thee o zachariah verily we announce to thee a son his name john that name we have given to none before him he said o my lord how when my wife is barren shall i have a son and wheni have now reached old age failing in my powers he said so shall it be thy lord hath said easy is this to me for icreated thee aforetime when thou wast nothing he said vouchsafe me o my lord a sign he said thy sign shall be thatfor three nights though sound in health thou speakest not to man and he came forth from the sanctuary to his people and made signs to them tosing praises morn and even we said o john receive the book with purpose of heart and we bestowedon him wisdom while yet a child and mercifulness from ourself and purity and pious was he and duteous tohis parents and not proud rebellious and peace was on him on the day he was born and the day of his death andshall be on the day when he shall be raised to life and make mention in the book of mary when she went apart from her family eastward and took a veil to shroud herself from them and we sent our spirit to her and he took before her the form of a perfect man she said i fly for refuge from thee to the god of mercy if thou fearesthim begone from me he said i am only a messenger of thy lord that i may bestow on thee a holyson she said how shall i have a son when man hath never touched me and i amnot unchaste he said so shall it be thy lord hath said easy is this with me and wewill make him a sign to mankind and a mercy from us for it is a thingdecreed and she conceived him and retired with him to a far off place and the throes came upon her by the trunk of a palm she said oh wouldthat i had died ere this and been a thing forgotten forgotten quite and one cried to her from below her grieve not thou thy lord hathprovided a streamlet at thy feet and shake the trunk of the palm tree toward thee it will drop fresh ripedates upon thee eat then and drink and be of cheerful eye and shouldst thou see a man say verily i have vowed abstinence to the god of mercy to no one will ispeak this day then came she with the babe to her people bearing him they said o mary now hast thou done a strange thing o sister of aaron thy father was not a man of wickedness nor unchaste thymother and she made a sign to them pointing towards the babe they said how shallwe speak with him who is in the cradle an infant it said verily i am the servant of god he hath given me the book andhe hath made me a prophet and he hath made me blessed wherever i may be and hath enjoined me prayerand almsgiving so long as i shall live and to be duteous to her that bare me and he hath not made me proud depraved and the peace of god was on me the day i was born and will be the day ishall die and the day i shall be raised to life this is jesus the son of mary this is a statement of the truth concerningwhich they doubt it beseemeth not god to beget a son glory be to him when he decreeth athing he only saith to it be and it is and verily god is my lord and your lord adore him then this is the rightway but the sects have fallen to variance among themselves about jesus but woe because of the assembly of a great day to those who believe not make them hear make them behold the day when they shall come before us butthe offenders this day are in a manifest error warn them of the day of sighing when the decree shall be accomplished whilethey are sunk in heedlessness and while they believe not verily we will inherit the earth and all who are upon it to us shall theybe brought back make mention also in the book of abraham for he was a man of truth aprophet when he said to his father o my father why dost thou worship that whichneither seeth nor heareth nor profiteth thee aught o my father verily now hath knowledge come to me which hath not come tothee follow me therefore i will guide thee into an even path o my father worship not satan for satan is a rebel against the god ofmercy o my father indeed i fear lest a chastisement from the god of mercy lightupon thee and thou become satan s vassal he said castest thou off my gods o abraham if thou forbear not i willsurely stone thee begone from me for a length of time he said peace be on thee i will pray my lord for thy forgiveness for heis gracious to me but i will separate myself from you and the gods ye call on beside god andon my lord will i call haply my prayers to my lord will not be with illsuccess and when he had separated himself from them and that which they worshippedbeside god we bestowed on him isaac and jacob and each of them we made aprophet and we bestowed gifts on them in our mercy and gave them the lofty tongue oftruth and commemorate moses in the book for he was a man of purity moreover hewas an apostle a prophet from the right side of the mountain we called to him and caused him to drawnigh to us for secret converse and we bestowed on him in our mercy his brother aaron a prophet and commemorate ismael in the book for he was true to his promise and wasan apostle a prophet and he enjoined prayer and almsgiving on his people and was well pleasing tohis lord and commemorate edris in the book for he was a man of truth a prophet and we uplifted him to a place on high these are they among the prophets of the posterity of adam and among thosewhom we bare with noah and among the posterity of abraham and israel andamong those whom we have guided and chosen to whom god hath shewed favour when the signs of the god of mercy were rehearsed to them they bowed themdown worshipping and weeping but others have come in their place after them they have made an end ofprayer and have gone after their own lusts and in the end they shall meetwith evil save those who turn and believe and do that which is right these shall enterthe garden and in nought shall they be wronged the garden of eden which the god of mercy hath promised to his servants though yet unseen for his promise shall come to pass no vain discourse shall they hear therein but only peace and their foodshall be given them at morn and even this is the paradise which we will make the heritage of those our servantswho fear us we come not down from heaven but by thy lord s command his whatever isbefore us and whatever is behind us and whatever is between the two and thylord is not forgetful lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them worship him then and abide thou steadfast in his worship knowest thou anyother of the same name man saith what after i am dead shall i in the end be brought forthalive doth not man bear in mind that we made him at first when he was nought and i swear by thy lord we will surely gather together them and the satans then will we set them on their knees round hell then will we take forth from each band those of them who have been stoutestin rebellion against the god of mercy then shall we know right well to whom its burning is most due no one is there of you who shall not go down unto it this is a settleddecree with thy lord then will we deliver those who had the fear of god and the wicked will weleave in it on their knees and when our clear signs are rehearsed to them the infidels say to those whobelieve which of the two parties is in the best plight and which is themost goodly company but how many generations have we brought to ruin before them who surpassedthem in riches and in splendour say as to those who are in error the god of mercy will lengthen out to thema length of daysuntil they see that with which they are threatened whether it be somepresent chastisement or whether it be the hour and they shall then knowwhich is in the worse state and which the more weak in forces but god will increase the guidance of the already guided and good works which abide are in thy lord s sight better in respect ofguerdon and better in the issue than all worldly good hast thou marked him who believeth not in our signs and saith i shallsurely have riches and children bestowed upon me hath he mounted up into the secrets of god hath he made a compact with thegod of mercy no we will certainly write down what he saith and will lengthen the lengthof his chastisement and we will inherit what he spake of and he shall come before us all alone they have taken other gods beside god to be their help but it shall not be those gods will disavow their worship and will becometheir enemies seest thou not that we send the satans against the infidels to urge them intosin wherefore be not thou in haste with them for a small number of days do wenumber to them one day we will gather the god fearing before the god of mercy with honoursdue but the sinners will we drive unto hell like flocks driven to the watering none shall have power to intercede save he who hath received permission atthe hands of the god of mercy they say the god of mercy hath gotten offspring now have ye done amonstrous thing almost might the very heavens be rent thereat and the earth cleave asunder and the mountains fall down in fragments that they ascribe a son to the god of mercy when it beseemeth not the god ofmercy to beget a son verily there is none in the heavens and in the earth but shall approach thegod of mercy as a servant he hath taken note of them and numbered them withexact numbering and each of them shall come to him on the day of resurrection singly but love will the god of mercy vouchsafe to those who believe and do thethings that be right verily we have made this koran easy and in

compassionate the mercifulsad by the koran full of warning in sooth the infidels are absorbed inpride in contention with thee how many generations have we destroyed before them and they cried for mercybut no time was it of escape and they marvel that a warner from among themselves hath come to them andthe infidels say this is a sorcerer a liar maketh he the gods to be but one god a strange thing forsooth is this and their chiefs took themselves off go said they and cleave steadfastlyto your gods ye see the thing aimed at we heard not of this in the previous creed it is but an imposture to him alone of us all hath a book of warning been sent down yes they arein doubt as to my warnings for they have not yet tasted my vengeance are the treasures of the mercy of thy lord the mighty the bounteous intheir hands is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is betweenthem theirs then let them mount up by cords any army of the confederates shall here be routed before them the people of noah and ad and pharaoh the impaler treated theirprophets as impostors and themoud and the people of lot and the dwellers in the forest thesewere the confederates nought did they all but charge the apostles with falsehood just therefore the retribution and these meccans await but one single trumpet blast there shall be nodelaying it yet they dare to say o our lord hasten our lot to us before the day ofreckoning put thou up with what they say and remember our servant david a man strongof hand one who turned him to us in penitence we constrained the mountains to join with him in lauds at even and atsunrise and the birds which flocked to him and would all return to him oft and we stablished his kingdom and wisdom and skill to pronounce cleardecisions did we bestow on him hath the story of the two pleaders reached thee o muhammad when theymounted the walls of his closet when they entered in upon david and he was frightened at them they said be not afraid we are two opposing parties one of us hath wronged theother judge therefore with truth between us and be not unjust but guide usto the right way now this my brother had ninety and nine ewes and i had but a single ewe andhe said make me her keeper and he over persuaded me in the dispute he said certainly he hath wronged thee in asking for thine ewe to add herto his own ewes and truly many associates do one another wrong except thosewho believe and do the things that are right and few indeed are they anddavid perceived that we had tried him so he asked pardon of his lord andfell down and bowed himself and repented so we forgave him that his sin and truly he shall have a high rank with us and an excellent retreat in paradise o david verily we have made thee our vicegerent upon earth judge thereforebetween men with truth and follow not thy passions lest they cause thee toerr from the way of god for they who err from the way of god shall meet witha grievous chastisement for that they have forgotten the day of reckoning we have not created the heaven and the earth and what is between them fornought that is the thought of infidels but woe to the infidels because ofthe fire shall we treat those who believe and do the things that are right like thosewho propagate evil on earth shall we treat the god fearing like the impious a blessed book have we sent down to thee that men may meditate its verses and that those endued with understanding may bear it in mind and solomon gave we unto david an excellent servant for he loved to turnhim godward remember when at eventide the prancing chargers were displayed before him and he said truly i have loved the love of earthly goods above theremembrance of my lord till the sun hath been hidden by the veil ofdarkness bring them back to me and he began to sever the legs and necks we also made trial of solomon and placed a phantom on his throne whereupon he returned to us in penitence he said o my lord pardon me and give me a dominion that may not be to anyone beside me for thou art the liberal giver so we subjected the wind to him it ran softly at his bidding whithersoeverhe directed it and the satans every builder and diver and others bound in chains this said we is our gift be bounteous then or withhold thy favours noaccount shalt thou render and his rank also is high with us and an excellent retreat and remember our servant job when he cried to his lord verily satan hathlaid on me disease and pain stamp said we with thy foot this is to wash with cool and todrink and we gave him back his family and as many more with them in our mercy andfor a monition to men of judgment and we said take in thine hand a rod and strike with it nor break thineoath verily we found him patient how excellent a servant one who turned to us was he and remember our servants abraham and isaac and jacob men of might andvision with this cleansing did we cleanse them the remembrance of the abode ofparadise and verily they were in our sight of the elect and of the good and remember ishmael and elisha and dhoulkefl for all these were of thejust this is a monition and verily the pious shall have a goodly retreat gardens of eden whose portals shall stand open to them therein reclining they shall there call for many a fruit and drink and with them shall be virgins of their own age with modest retiringglances this is what ye were promised at the day of reckoning yes this is our provision it shall never fail even so but for the evil doers is a wretched home hell wherein they shall be burned how wretched a bed even so let

shall be burned in thefire they shall say but ye too there shall be no welcome for you it was yewho prepared this for us and wretched is the abode they will say o our lord increase twofold in the fire the punishment ofhim who hath brought this upon us and they will say why see we not the men whom we numbered among the wicked whom we used to treat with scorn have they escaped our eyes verily this is truth the wrangling together of the people of the fire say i am but a warner and there is no god but god the one the almighty lord of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them thepotent the forgiving say this is a weighty message from which ye turn aside yet had i no knowledge of what passed among the celestial chiefs when theydisputed verily it hath been revealed to me

hands have made is it that thou are puffed up with pride or art thou a being of loftymerit he said i am more excellent than he me hast thou created of fire ofclay hast thou created him he said begone then hence thou art accursed and lo my ban shall be on thee till the day of the reckoning he said o my lord respite me till the day of resurrection he said one then of the respited shalt thou be till the day of the time appointed he said i swear by thy might then that all of them will i seduce save thy sincere servants among them he said it is truth and the truth i speak from thee will i surely

after a time shall ye surely know its message the letter s see sura lxviii p these verses are said to have been revealed when upon the conversion ofomar the koreisch went in a body to abu talib and

xxxvi ya sin lx mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulya sin by the wise koran surely of the sent ones thou upon a right path a revelation of the mighty the merciful that thou shouldest warn a people whose fathers were not warned and thereforelived in heedlessness just now is our sentence against most of them therefore they shall notbelieve on their necks have we placed chains which reach the chin and forced up aretheir heads before them have we set a barrier and behind them a barrier and we haveshrouded them in a veil so that they shall not see alike is it to them if thou warn them or warn them not they will notbelieve him only shalt thou really warn who followeth the monition and feareth thegod of mercy in secret him cheer with tidings of pardon and of a noblerecompense verily it is we who will quicken the dead and write down the works whichthey have sent on before them and the traces which they shall have leftbehind them and everything have we set down in the clear book of ourdecrees set forth to them the instance of the people of the city when the sent onescame to it when we sent two unto them and they charged them both with imposture therefore with a third we strengthened them and they said verily we arethe sent unto you of god they said ye are only men like us nought hath the god of mercy sent down ye do nothing but lie they said our lord knoweth that we are surely sent unto you to proclaim a clear message is our only duty they said of a truth we augur ill from you if ye desist not we willsurely stone you and a grievous punishment will surely befall you from us they said your augury of ill is with yourselves will ye be warned nay ye are an erring people then from the end of the city a man came running he said o my people follow the sent ones follow those who ask not of you a recompense and who are rightly guided and why should i not worship him who made me and to whom ye shall be broughtback shall i take gods beside him if the god of mercy be pleased to afflict me their intercession will not avert from me aught nor will they deliver truly then should i be in a manifest error verily in your lord have i believed therefore hear me it was said to him enter thou into paradise and he said oh that mypeople knewhow gracious god hath been to me and that he hath made me one of hishonoured ones but no army sent we down out of heaven after his death nor were we thensending down our angels there was but one shout from gabriel and lo they were extinct oh the misery that rests upon my servants no apostle cometh to them butthey laugh him to scorn see they not how many generations we have destroyed before them not to false gods is it that they shall be brought back but all gathered together shall be set before us moreover the dead earth is a sign to them we quicken it and bring forth thegrain from it and they eat thereof and we make in it gardens of the date and vine and we cause springs to gushforth in it that they may eat of its fruits and of the labour of their hands will theynot therefore be thankful glory be to him who hath created all the sexual pairs of such things asearth produceth and of mankind themselves and of things beyond their ken a sign to them also is the night we withdraw the day from it and lo theyare plunged in darkness and the sun hasteneth to her place of rest this the ordinance of themighty the knowing and as for the moon we have decreed stations for it till it change like anold and crooked palm branch to the sun it is not given to overtake the moon nor doth the night outstripthe day but each in its own sphere doth journey on it is also a sign to them that we bare their posterity in the full laden ark and that we have made for them vessels like it on which they embark and if we please we drown them and there is none to help them and they arenot rescued unless through our mercy and that they may enjoy themselves for yet awhile and when it is said to them fear what is before you and what is behindyou that ye may obtain mercy aye not one sign from among the signs of their lord dost thou bring them but they turn away from it and when it is said to them give alms of what god hath bestowed on you they who believe not say to the believers shall we feed him whom god canfeed if he will truly ye are in no other than a plain error and they say when will this promise be fulfilled if what ye say be true they await but a single blast as they are wrangling shall it assail them and not a bequest shall they be able to make nor to their families shallthey return and the trumpet shall be blown and lo they shall speed out of theirsepulchres to their lord they shall say oh woe to us who hath roused us from our sleeping place tis what the god of mercy promised and the apostles spake the truth but one blast shall there be and lo they shall be assembled before us all together and on that day shall no soul be wronged in the least neither shall ye berewarded but as ye shall have wrought but joyous on that day shall be the inmates of paradise in their employ in shades on bridal couches reclining they and their spouses therein shall they have fruits and shall have whatever they require peace shall be the word on the part of a merciful lord but be ye separated this day o ye sinners did i not enjoin on you o sons of adam worship not satan for that he isyour declared foe but worship me this is a right path but now hath he led a vast host of you astray did ye not then comprehend this is hell with which ye were threatened endure its heat this day for that ye believed not on that day will we set a seal upon their mouths yet shall their hands speakunto us and their feet shall bear witness of that which they shall havedone and if we

theywould not be able to move onward or to return him cause we to stoop through age whose days we lengthen will they notunderstand we have not taught him muhammad poetry nor would it beseem him thisbook is no other than a warning and a clear koran to warn whoever liveth and that against the infidels sentence may be justlygiven see they not that we have created for them among the things which our handshave wrought the animals of which they are masters and that we have subjected them unto them and on some they ride and ofothers they eat and they find in them profitable uses and beverages yet have they taken other gods beside god that they might be helpful to them no power have they to succour them yet are their votaries an army at theirservice let not their speech grieve thee we know

some of his own servants for offspring verily manis an open ingrate hath god adopted daughters from among those whom he hath created and chosensons for you but when that is announced to any one of them which he affirmeth to be thecase with the god of mercy his face settleth into darkness and he issilent sad what make they a being to be the offspring of god who is brought up amongtrinkets and is ever contentious without reason and they make the angels who are the servants of god of mercy females what did they witness their creation their witness shall be taken down and theyshall hereafter be enquired at and they say had the god of mercy so willed it we should never haveworshipped them no knowledge have they in this they only lie have we ere this given them a book and do they possess it still but say they verily we found our fathers of that persuasion and verily bytheir footsteps do we guide ourselves and thus never before thy time did we send a warner to any city but itswealthy ones said verily we found our fathers with a religion and in theirtracks we tread say such was our command to that apostle what even if i bring you areligion more right than that ye found your fathers following and theysaid verily we believe not in your message wherefore we took vengeance on them and behold what hath been the end ofthose who treated our messengers as liars and bear in mind when abraham said to his father and to his people verily iam clear of what ye worship save him who hath created me for he will vouchsafe me guidance and this he established as a doctrine that should abide among his posterity that to god might they be turned in sooth to these idolatrous arabians and to their fathers did i allow theirfull enjoyments till the truth should come to them and an undoubtedapostle but now that the truth hath come to them they say tis sorcery and webelieve it not and they say had but this koran been sent down to some great one of the twocities are they then the distributors of thy lord s mercy it is we who distributetheir subsistence among them in this world s life and we raise some of themby grades above others that the one may take the other to serve him butbetter is the mercy of thy lord than all their hoards but for fear that all mankind would have become a single people ofunbelievers verily we would certainly have given to those who believe not inthe god of mercy roofs of silver to their houses and silver stairs to ascendby and doors of silver to their houses and couches of silver to recline on and ornaments of gold for all these are merely the good things of thepresent life but the next life doth thy lord reserve for those who fear him and whoso shall withdraw from the warning of the god of mercy we will chaina satan to him and he shall be his fast companion for the satans will turn men aside from the way who yet shall deemthemselves rightly guided until when man shall come before us he shall say o satan would thatbetween me and thee were the distance of the east and west and a wretchedcompanion is a satan but it shall not avail you on that day because ye were unjust partnersshall ye be in the torment what canst thou then make the deaf to hear or guide the blind and him whois in palpable error whether therefore we take thee off by death surely will we avenge ourselveson them or whether we make thee a witness of the accomplishment of that with which wethreatened them we will surely gain the mastery over them hold thou fast therefore what hath been revealed to thee for thou art on aright path for truly to thee and to thy people it is an admonition and ye shall have anaccount to render for it at last and ask our sent ones whom we have sent before thee appointed we gods beside the god of mercy whom they should worship of old sent we moses with our signs to pharaoh and his nobles and he said i truly am the apostle of the lord of the worlds and when he presented himself before them with our signs lo they laughed atthem though we shewed them no sign that was not greater than its fellow andtherefore did we lay hold on them with chastisement to the intent that theymight be turned to god then they said o magician call on thy lord on our behalf to do as he hathengaged with thee for truly we would fain be guided but when we relieved them from the chastisement lo they broke their pledge and pharaoh made proclamation among his people said he o my people is notthe kingdom of egypt mine and these rivers which flow at my feet do yenot behold am i not mightier than this despicable fellow and who scarce can speak distinctly have bracelets of gold then been put upon him or come there with him atrain of angels and he inspired his people with levity and they obeyed him for they were aperverse people and when they had angered us we took vengeance on them and we drowned themall and we made them a precedent and instance of divine judgments to those whocame after them and when the son of mary was set forth as an instance of divine power lo thy people cried out for joy thereat and they said are our gods or is he the better they put this forth tothee only in the spirit of dispute yea they are a contentious people jesus is no more than a servant whom we favoured and proposed as an instanceof divine power to the children of israel and if we pleased we could from yourselves bring forth angels to succeedyou on earth and he shall be a sign of the last hour doubt not then of it and followye me this is the right way and let not satan turn you aside from it for he is your manifest foe and when jesus came with manifest proofs he said now am i come to you withwisdom and a part of those things about which ye are at variance i willclear up to you fear ye god therefore and obey me verily god is my lord and your lord wherefore worship ye him this is aright way but the different parties fell into disputes among themselves but woe tothose who thus transgressed because of the punishment of an afflictive day for what wait they but for the hour to come suddenly on them while theyexpect it not friends on that day shall become foes to one another except the god fearing o my servants on this day shall no fear come upon you neither shall ye beput to grief who have believed in our signs and become muslims enter ye and your wives into paradise delighted dishes and bowls of gold shall go round unto them there shall they enjoywhatever their souls desire and whatever their eyes delight in and thereinshall ye abide for ever this is paradise which ye have received as your heritage in recompense foryour works therein shall ye have fruits in abundance of which ye shall eat but in the torment of hell shall the wicked remain for ever it shall not be mitigated to them and they shall be mute for despairtherein for it is not we who have treated them unjustly but it was they who wereunjust to themselves and they shall cry o malec would that thy lord would make an end of us he saith here must ye remain we have come to you with the truth o meccans but most of you abhor thetruth have they drawn tight their toils for thee we too will tighten ours think they that we hear not their secrets and their private talk yes andour angels who are at their sides write them down say if the god of mercy had a son the first would i be to worship him but far be the lord of the heavens and of the earth the lord of the throne from that which they impute to him wherefore let them alone to plunge on and sport until they meet the daywith which they are menaced he who is god in the heavens is god in earth also and he is the wise theknowing and blessed be he whose is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and ofall that is between them for with him is the knowledge of the hour and tohim shall ye be brought back the gods whom they call upon beside him shall not be able to intercede forothers they only shall be able who bore witness to the truth and knew it if thou ask them who hath created them they will be sure to say god howthen hold they false opinions and one saith o lord verily these are people who believe not turn thou then from them and say peace in the end they

hath been revealed to me that a company ofdjinn listened and said verily we have heard a marvellous discourse koran it guideth to the truth wherefore we believed in it and we will nothenceforth join any being with our lord and he may the majesty of our lord be exalted hath taken no spouse neitherhath he any offspring but the foolish among us hath spoken of god that which is unjust and we verily thought that no one amongst men or djinn would have uttered alie against god there are indeed people among men who have sought for refuge unto peopleamong djinn but they only increased their folly and they thought as ye think that god would not raise any from the dead and the heavens did we essay but found them filled with a mighty garrison and with flaming darts and we sat on some of the seats to listen but whoever listeneth findeth anambush ready for him of flaming darts and truly we know not whether evil be meant for them that are on earth orwhether their lord meaneth guidance for them and there are among us good and others among us of another kind we are ofvarious sorts and verily we thought that no one could weaken god on earth neither could weescape from him by flight wherefore as soon as we had heard the guidance we believed in it andwhoever believeth in his lord need not fear either loss or wrong there are some among us who have resigned themselves to god the muslims and there are others of us who have gone astray and whoso resigneth himselfto god pursueth the way of truth but they who go astray from it shall be fuel for hell moreover if they the meccans keep straight on in that way we will surelygive them to drink of abundant waters that we may prove them thereby but whoso withdraweth from the remembrance ofhis lord him will he send into a severe torment it is unto god that the temples are set apart call not then on any othertherein with god when the servant of god stood up to call upon him the djinn almost jostledhim by their crowds say i call only upon my lord and i join no other being with him say no control have i over what may hurt or benefit you say verily none can protect me against god neither shall i find any refuge beside him my sole work is preaching from god and his message and for such as shallrebel against god and his apostle is the fire of hell they shall remaintherein alway for ever until they see their threatened vengeance they will be perverse but thenshall they know which side was the weakest in a protector and the fewest innumber say i know not whether that with which ye are threatened be nigh or whethermy lord hath assigned it to a distant day he knoweth the secret nor doth hedivulge his secret to any except to that apostle who pleaseth him and before him and behind him hemaketh a guard to march that he may know if his apostles have verily delivered the messages of theirlord and he embraceth in his knowledge all their ways and taketh count ofall that concerneth them this interview with the djinn took place at

forgiving who hath created seven heavens one above another no defect canst thou see inthe creation of the god of mercy repeat the gaze seest thou a single flaw then twice more repeat the gaze thy gaze shall return to thee dulled andweary moreover we have decked the lowest heaven with lights and have placed themthere to be hurled at the satans for whom we have prepared the torment ofthe flaming fire

fury so oft as a crowd shall be thrown into it its keepers shall ask them came not the warner to you they shall say yes there came to us one charged with warnings but wetreated him as a liar and said nothing hath god sent down ye are innothing but a vast delusion and they shall say had we but hearkened or understood we had not beenamong the dwellers in the flames and their sin shall they acknowledge but avaunt ye dwellers in theflame but pardon and a great reward for those who fear their lord in secret be your converse hidden or open he truly knoweth the inmost recess of yourbreasts

the resurrection what are ye sure that he who is in heaven will not cleave the earth beneathyou and lo it shall quake or are ye sure that he who is in heaven will not send against you a stone charged whirlwind then shall ye know what my warning meant and verily those who flourish before you treated their prophets as liars and how grievous my wrath behold they not the birds over their heads outstretching and drawing intheir wings none save the god of mercy upholdeth them for he regardethall things who is he that can be as an army to you to succour you except the god ofmercy truly the infidels are in the merest delusion or who is he that will furnish you supplies if he withhold his supplies yetdo they persist in pride and in fleeing from him is he who goeth along grovelling on his face better guided than he who goethupright on a straight path say it is he who hath brought you forth and gifted you with hearing andsight and heart yet how few are grateful say it is he who hath sown you in the earth and to him shall ye begathered and they say when shall this threat be put in force if ye speak thetruth say nay truly this knowledge is with god alone and i am only an openwarner but when they shall see it nigh sad shall wax the countenances of theinfidels and it shall be said this is what ye have been calling for say what think ye whether god destroy me or not and those who follow me or whether he have mercy on us yet who will protect the infidels from awoeful torment say he is the god of mercy in him do we believe and in him put we ourtrust and ye shall know hereafter who is in a manifest error say what think ye if at early morn your waters shall have sunk away whothen will give you clear running water thus shakespeare uses the word braying of clamours of hell and miltonspeaks of braying horrible discord comp sura xxv der alles durchdringt ullm perspicax mar sagacious sale the primarymeaning of the arabic root is to draw near hence the above signification inthe

mercifulhappy now the believers who humble them in their prayer and who keep aloof from vain words and who are doers of alms deeds and who restrain their appetites save with their wives or the slaves whom their right hands possess for inthat case they shall be free from blame but they whose desires reach further than this are transgressors and who tend well their trusts and their covenants and who keep them strictly to their prayers these shall be the heritors who shall inherit the paradise to abide therein for ever now of fine clay have we created man then we placed him a moist germ in a safe abode then made we the moist germ a clot of blood then made the clotted blood intoa piece of flesh then made the piece of flesh into bones and we clothed thebones with flesh then brought forth man of yet another make blessedtherefore be god the most excellent of makers then after this ye shall surely die then shall ye be waked up on the day of resurrection and we have created over you seven heavens and we are not careless of thecreation and we send down water from the heaven in its due degree and we cause it tosettle on the earth and we have power for its withdrawal and by it we cause gardens of palm trees and vineyards to spring forth foryou in which ye have plenteous fruits and whereof ye eat and the tree that groweth up on mount sinai which yieldeth oil and a juicefor those who eat and there is a lesson for you in the cattle we give you to drink of what isin their bellies and many advantages do ye derive from them and for foodthey serve you and on them and on ships are ye borne we sent noah heretofore unto his people and he said o my people servegod ye have no other god than he will ye not therefore fear him but the chiefs of the people who believed not said this is but a man likeyourselves he fain would raise himself above you but had it pleased god tosend he would have sent angels we heard not of this with our sires of old verily he is but a man possessed leave him alone therefore for a time he said o my lord help me against their charge of imposture so we revealed unto him make the ark under our eye and as we have taught and when our doom shall come on and the earth s surface shall boil up carry into it of every kind a pair and thy family save him on whom sentencehath already passed and plead not with me for the wicked for they shall bedrowned and when thou and they who shall be with thee shall go up into the ark say praise be unto god who hath rescued us from the wicked folk and say o my lord disembark me with a blessed disembarking for thou artthe best to disembark verily in this were signs and verily we made proof of man we then raised up other generations after them and we sent among them an apostle from out themselves with worship ye god ye have no other god than he will ye not therefore fear him and the chiefs of his people who believed not and who deemed the meetingwith us in the life to come to be a lie and whom we had richly supplied inthis present life said this is but a man like yourselves he eateth ofwhat ye eat and he drinketh of what ye drink and if ye obey a man like yourselves then ye will surely be undone what doth he foretell you that after ye shall be dead and become dust andbones ye shall be brought forth away away with his predictions there is no life beyond our present life we die and we live and we shallnot be quickened again this is merely a man who forgeth a lie about god and we will not believehim he said o my lord help me against this charge of imposture he said yet a little and they will soon repent them then did the shout of the destroying angel in justice surprise them we madethem like leaves swept down by a torrent away then with the wicked people then raised we up other generations after them neither too soon nor too late shall a people reach its appointed time then sent we our apostles one after another oft as their apostle presentedhimself to a nation they treated him as a liar and we caused one nation tofollow another and we made them the burden of a tale away then with thepeople who believe not then sent we moses and his brother aaron with our signs and manifest power to pharaoh and his princes but they behaved them proudly for they were ahaughty people and they said shall we believe on two men like ourselves whose people areour slaves and they treated them both as impostors wherefore they became of thedestroyed and we gave moses the book for israel s guidance and we appointed the son of mary and his mother for a sign and we preparedan abode for both in a lofty spot quiet and watered with springs o ye apostles eat of things that are good and do that which is right ofyour doings i am cognisant and truly this your religion is the one religion and i am your lord therefore fear me but men have rent their great concern one among another into sects everyparty rejoicing in that which is their own wherefore leave them till a certain time in their depths of error what think they that what we largely bestow on them of wealth and children we hasten to them for their good nay they have no knowledge but they who are awed with the dread of their lord and who believe in the signs of their lord and who join no other gods with their lord and who give that which they give with hearts thrilled with dread becausethey must return unto their lord these hasten after good and are the first to win it we will not burden a soul beyond its power and with us is a book whichspeaketh the truth and they shall not be wronged but as to this book their hearts are plunged in error and their works arefar other than those of muslims and they will work those works until when we lay hold on their affluent ones with punishment lo they cryfor help cry not for help this day for by us ye shall not be succoured long since were my signs rehearsed to you but ye turned back on your heels puffed up with pride discoursing foolishly by night do they not then heed the things spoken whether that hath come to them whichcame not to their fathers of old or do they not recognise their apostle and therefore disavow him or say they a djinn is in him nay he hath come to them with the truth but the truth do most of them abhor but if the truth had followed in the train of their desires the heavens andthe earth and all that therein is had surely come to ruin but we havebrought them their warning and from their warning they withdraw dost thou ask them for remuneration but remuneration from thy lord is best and he is the best provider and thou indeed biddest them to the right path but verily they who believe not in the life to come from that path do surelywander and if we had taken compassion on them and relieved them from their trouble they would have plunged on in their wickedness wildly wandering we formerly laid hold on them with chastisement yet they did not humble themto their lord nor did they abase them until when we have opened upon them the door of a severe punishment lo they are in despair at it it is he who hath implanted in you hearing and sight and heart how few ofyou give thanks it is he who hath caused you to be born on the earth and unto him shall yebe gathered and it is he who maketh alive and killeth and of him is the change of thenight and of the day will ye not understand but they say as said those of old they say what when we shall be dead and have become dust and bones shallwe indeed be waked to life this have we been promised we and our fathers aforetime but it is onlyfables of the ancients say whose is the earth and all that is therein if ye know they will answer god s say will ye not then reflect say who is the lord of the seven heavens and the lord of the gloriousthrone they will say they are god s say will ye not then fear him say in whose hand is the empire of all things who protecteth but is notprotected if ye know they will answer in god s say how then can ye be so spell bound yea we have brought them the truth but they are surely liars god hath not begotten offspring neither is there any other god with him else had each god assuredly taken away that which he had created and somehad assuredly uplifted themselves above others far from the glory of god bewhat they affirm of him he knoweth alike the unseen and the seen far be he uplifted above the godswhom they associate with him say o my lord if thou wilt let me witness the infliction of that with whichthey have been threatened o my lord place me not among the ungodly people verily we are well able to make thee see the punishment with which we havethreatened them turn aside evil with that which is better we best know what they utteragainst thee and say o my lord i betake me to thee against the promptings of thesatans and i betake me to thee o my lord that they gain no hurtful access to me when death overtaketh one of the wicked he saith lord send me back again that i may do the good which i have left undone by no means these arethe very words which he shall speak but behind them shall be a barrier until the day when they shall be raisedagain and when the trumpet shall be sounded the ties of kindred between them shallcease on that day neither shall they ask each other s help they whose balances shall be heavy shall be the blest but they whose balances shall be light these are they who shall lose theirsouls abiding in hell for ever the fire shall scorch their faces and their lips shall quiver therein what were not my signs rehearsed unto you and did ye not treat them aslies they shall say o our lord our ill fortune prevailed against us and webecame an erring people o our lord bring us forth hence if we go back again to our sins we shallindeed be evil doers he will say be ye driven down into it and address me not a part truly of my servants was there who said o our lord we believe forgive us then and be merciful to us for of the merciful art thou thebest but ye received them with such scoffs that they suffered you to forget mywarning and ye laughed them to scorn verily this day will i reward then for their patient endurance the blissfulones shall they be he will say what number of years tarried ye on earth they will say we tarried a day or part of a day but ask the recordingangels god will say short indeed was the time ye tarried if that ye knew it what did ye then think that we had created you for pastime and that yeshould not be brought back again to us wherefore let god be exalted theking the truth there is no god but he lord of the stately throne andwhoso together with god shall call on another god for whom he hath noproof shall surely have to give account to his lord aye it shall fare illwith the infidels and say o my lord pardon and have mercy for of those who show mercy artthou the best this sura is said by wahidi intr and by assuyûti to be the lastmeccan revelation but there seems to be no reason for this opinion in prayer eccl v i matt vi but it may be understood of idle talkgenerally see sura xxii n that is a perfect man at last composed of soul and body the verb halaka to create is used throughout for which i have necessarily substituted tomake in order to retain the same word

the name of god the compassionate the mercifulthis people s reckoning hath drawn nigh yet sunk in carelessness they turnaside every fresh warning that cometh to them from their lord they only hear tomock it their hearts set on lusts and they who have done this wrong say in secretdiscourse is he more than a man like yourselves what will ye with youreyes open accede to sorcery say my lord knoweth what is spoken in the heaven and on the earth he isthe hearer the knower nay say they it is the medley of dreams nay he hath forged it nay heis a poet let him come to us with a sign as the prophets of old were sent before their time none of the cities which we have destroyed believed willthese men then believe and we sent none previous to thee but men to whom we had revealedourselves ask ye the people who are warned by scriptures if ye know itnot we gave them not bodies which could dispense with food and they were not tolive for ever then made we good our promise to them and we delivered them and whom wepleased and we destroyed the transgressors and now have we sent down to you the book in which is your warning what will ye not then understand and how many a guilty city have we broken down and raised up after it otherpeoples and when they felt our vengeance lo they fled from it flee not said the angels in mockery but come back to that wherein yerevelled and to your abodes questions will haply be put to you they said oh woe to us verily we have been evil doers and this ceased not to be their cry until we made them like reaped corn extinct we created not the heaven and the earth and what is between them for sport had it been our wish to find a pastime we had surely found it in ourselves if to do so had been our will nay we will hurl the truth at falsehood and it shall smite it and lo itshall vanish but woe be to you for what ye utter of god all beings in the heaven and on the earth are his and they who are in hispresence disdain not his service neither are they wearied they praise him night and day they rest not have they taken gods from the earth who can quicken the dead had there been in either heaven or earth gods besides god both surely hadgone to ruin but glory be to god the lord of the throne beyond what theyutter he shall not be asked of his doings but they shall be asked have they taken other gods beside him say bring forth your proofs that theyare gods this is the warning of those who are with me and the warning ofthose who were before me but most of them know not the truth and turnaside no apostle have we sent before thee to whom we did not reveal that verilythere is no god beside me therefore worship me yet they say the god of mercy hath begotten issue from the angels glorybe to him nay they are but his honoured servants they speak not till he hath spoken and they do his bidding he knoweth what is before them and what is behind them and no plea shallthey offersave for whom he pleaseth and they tremble for fear of him and that angel among them who saith i am a god beside him will werecompense with hell in such sort will we recompense the offenders do not the infidels see that the heavens and the earth were both a solidmass and that we clave them asunder and that by means of water we give lifeto everything will they not then believe and we set mountains on the earth lest it should move with them and we madeon it broad passages between them as routes for their guidance and we made the heaven a roof strongly upholden yet turn they away from itssigns and he it is who hath created the night and the day and the sun and themoon each moving swiftly in its sphere at no time have we granted to man a life that shall last for ever if thouthen die shall they live for ever every soul shall taste of death and for trial will we prove you with eviland with good and unto us shall ye be brought back and when the infidels see thee they receive thee only with scoffs what isthis he who maketh such mention of your gods yet when mention is made tothem of the god of mercy they believe not man say they is made up of haste but i will shew you my signs desire them not then to be hastened they say when will this threat be made good tell us if ye be men oftruth did the infidels but know the time when they shall not be able to keep thefire of hell from their faces or from their backs neither shall they behelped but it shall come on them suddenly and shall confound them and they shallnot be able to put it back neither shall they be respited other apostles have been scoffed at before thee but that doom at which theymocked encompassed the scoffers say who shall protect you by night and by day from the god of mercy yetturn they away from the warning of their lord have they gods beside us who can defend them for their own succour have theyno power neither shall the gods they join with god screen them from us yes we have given these men and their fathers enjoyments so long as theirlife lasted what see they not that we come to a land and straiten itsborders is it they who are the conquerors say i only warn you of what hath been revealed to me but the deaf will nothear the call whenever they are warned yet if a breath of thy lord s chastisement touch them they will assuredlysay oh woe to us we have indeed been offenders just balances will we set up for the day of the resurrection neither shallany soul be wronged in aught though were a work but the weight of a grainof mustard seed we would bring it forth to be weighed and our reckoningwill suffice we gave of old to moses and aaron the illumination and a light and awarning for the god fearing who dread their lord in secret and who tremble for the hour and this koran which we have sent down is a blessed warning will ye thendisown it of old we gave unto abraham his direction for we knew him worthy when he said to his father and to his people what are these images to whichye are devoted they said we found our fathers worshipping them he said truly ye and your fathers have been in a plain mistake they said hast thou come unto us in earnest or art thou of those whojest he said nay your lord is lord of the heavens and of the earth who hathcreated them both and to this am i one of those who witness and by god i will certainly lay a plot against your idols after ye shallhave retired and turned your backs so he broke them all in pieces except the chief of them that to it theymight return inquiring they said who hath done this to our gods verily he is one of the unjust they said we heard a youth make mention of them they call him abraham they said then bring him before the people s eyes that they may witnessagainst him they said hast thou done this to our gods o abraham he said nay that their chief hath done it but ask ye them if they canspeak so they turned their thoughts upon themselves and said ye truly are theimpious persons then became headstrong in their former error and exclaimed thou knowestthat these speak not he said what do ye then worship instead of god that which doth notprofit you at all nor injure you fie on you and on that ye worship insteadof god what do ye not then understand they said burn him and come to the succour of your gods if ye will doanything at all we said o fire be thou cold and to abraham a safety and they sought to lay a plot against him but we made them the sufferers and we brought him and lot in safety to the land which we have blessed forall human beings and we gave him isaac and jacob as a farther gift and we made all of themrighteous we also made them models who should guide others by our command and weinspired them with good deeds and constancy in prayer and almsgiving andthey worshipped us and unto lot we gave wisdom and knowledge and we rescued him from the citywhich wrought filthiness for they were a people evil perverse and we caused him to enter into our mercy for he was of the righteous and remember noah when aforetime he cried to us and we heard him anddelivered him and his family from the great calamity and we helped him against the people who treated our signs as impostures anevil people verily were they and we drowned them all and david and solomon when they gave judgment concerning a field when somepeople s sheep had caused a waste therein and we were witnesses of theirjudgment and we gave solomon insight into the affair and on both of them we bestowedwisdom and knowledge and we constrained the mountains and the birds to joinwith david in our praise our doing was it and we taught david the art of making mail for you to defend you from eachother s violence will ye therefore be thankful and to solomon we subjected we subjected the strongly blowing wind it spedat his bidding to the land we had blessed for we know all things and sundry satans who should dive for him and perform other work beside and we kept watch over them and remember job when he cried to his lord truly evil hath touched me butthou art the most merciful of those who shew mercy so we heard him and lightened the burden of his woe and we gave him backhis family and as many more with them a mercy from us and a memorial forthose who serve us and ismael and edris and dhoulkefl all steadfast in patience and we caused them to enter into our mercy for they were of the righteous and dhoulnoun when he went on his way in anger and thought that we had nopower over him but in the darkness he cried there is no god but thou glorybe unto thee verily i have been one of the evil doers so we heard him and rescued him from misery for thus rescue we the faithful and zacharias when he called upon his lord saying o my lord leave me notchildless but there is no better heir than thyself so we heard him and gave him john and we made his wife fit for child bearing verily these vied in goodness and called upon us with love andfear and humbled themselves before us and her who kept her maidenhood and into whom we breathed of our spirit and made her and her son a sign to all creatures of a truth this your religion is the one religion and i your lord therefore serve me but they have rent asunder this their great concern among themselves intosects all of them

say if the angels be not sent down tous or unless we behold our lord ah they are proud of heart andexceed with great excess on the day when they shall see the angels no good news shall there be forthe guilty ones and they shall cry out a barrier that cannot be passed then will we proceed to the works which they have wrought and make them asscattered dust happier on that day the inmates of the

me would that i had not taken such an one for my friend it was he who led me astray from the warning which had reached me and satanis man s betrayer then said the apostle o my lord truly my people have esteemed this koranto be vain babbling thus have we given to every prophet an enemy from among the wicked ones butthy lord is a sufficient guide and helper and the infidels say unless the koran be sent down to him all at once but in this way would we stablish thy heart by it in parcels have weparcelled it out to thee nor shall they come to thee with puzzling questions but we will come tothee with the truth and their best solution they who shall be gathered upon their faces into hell shall have the worstplace and be farthest from the path of happiness heretofore we gave the law to moses and appointed his brother aaron to behis counsellor and we said go ye to the people who treat our signs as lies and themdestroyed we with utter destruction and as to the people of noah when they treated their apostles as impostors we drowned them and we made them a sign to mankind a grievous chastisementhave we prepared for the wicked and ad and themoud and the men of rass and divers generations betweenthem unto each of them did we set forth parables for warnings and each of themdid we utterly exterminate oft are this have the unbelieving meccans passed by the city on which wasrained a fatal rain what have they not seen it yet have they no hope of aresurrection and when they see thee they do but take thee as the subject of theirrailleries what is this he whom god has sent as an apostle indeed he had well nigh led us astray from our gods had we not perseveredsteadfastly in their service but in the end they shall know when theyshall see the punishment who hath most strayed from the path what thinkest thou he who hath taken his passions as a god wilt thou be aguardian over him thinkest thou that the greater part of them hear or understand they are justlike the brutes yes they stray even further from the right way hast thou not seen how thy lord lengtheneth out the shadow had he pleasedhe had made it motionless but we made the sun to be its guide then draw it in unto us with easy indrawing he it is who ordaineth the night as a garment and sleep for rest andordaineth the day for waking up to life he it is who sendeth the winds as the forerunner of his mercy rain andpure water send we down from heaven that we may revive by it a dead land and we give it for drink to ourcreation beasts and men in numbers and we distribute it among them on all sides that they may reflect but mostmen refuse to be aught but thankless had we pleased we had raised up a warner in every city give not way therefore to the infidels but by means of this koran striveagainst them with a mighty strife and he it is who hath let loose the two seas the one sweet fresh and theother salt bitter and hath put an interspace between them and a barrierthat cannot be passed and it is he who hath created man of water and established between themthe ties of kindred and affinity and potent is thy lord yet beside god do they worship what can neither help nor hurt them and theinfidel is satan s helper against his lord still we have sent thee only as a herald and a warner say i ask of you no recompense for it except from him who is willing totake the way to his lord and put thou thy trust in him that liveth and dieth not and celebrate hispraise he fully knoweth the faults of his servants who in six days createdthe heavens and the earth and whatever is between them then mounted histhrone the god of mercy ask now of the wise concerning him but when it is said to them bow down before the god of mercy they say who is the god of mercy shall we bow down to what thou biddest and theyfly from thee the more blessed be he who hath placed in the heaven the sign of the zodiac whohath placed in it the lamp of the sun and the light giving moon and it is he who hath ordained the night and the day to succeed one anotherfor those who desire to think on god or desire to be thankful and the servants of the god of mercy are they who walk upon the earth softly and when the ignorant address them they reply peace they that pass the night in the worship of their lord prostrate andstanding and that say o our lord turn away from us the torment of hell for itstorment is endless it is indeed an ill abode and resting place those who when they spend are neither lavish nor niggard but keep the mean those who call on no other gods with god nor slay whom god hath forbidden tobe slain except for a just cause and who commit not fornication for he whodoth this shall meet the reward of his wickedness doubled to him shall be the torment on the day of resurrection and in itshall he remain disgraced for ever save those who shall repent and believe and do righteous works for them godwill change their evil things into good things for god is gracious merciful and whose turneth to god and doeth what is right he verily will convert witha true conversion and they who bear not witness to that which is false and when they pass byfrivolous sport pass on with dignity and they who when monished by the signs of their lord fall not downthereat as if deaf and blind and who say o our lord give us in our wives and offspring the joy of oureyes and make us examples to those who fear thee these shall be rewarded with the high places of paradise for their steadfastendurance and they shall meet therein with welcome and salutation for ever shall they remain therein a fair

the hearer the seer and we gave the book to moses and ordained it for guidance to the childrenof israel that ye take no other guardian than me o posterity of those whom we bare with noah he truly was a grateful servant and we solemnly declared to the children of israel in the book twice surelywill ye enact crimes in the earth and with great loftiness of pride will yesurely be uplifted so when the menace for the first crime came to be inflicted we sent againstyou our servants endued with terrible prowess and they searched the inmostpart of your abodes and the menace was accomplished then we gave you the mastery over them in turn and increased you in wealthand children and made you a most numerous host we said if ye do well to your own behoof will ye do well and if ye doevil against yourselves will ye do it and when the menace for your lattercrime came to be inflicted then we sent an enemy to sadden your faces andto enter the temple as they entered it at first and to destroy with utterdestruction that which they had conquered haply your lord will have mercy on you but if ye return we will return and we have appointed hell the prison of the infidels verily this koran guideth to what is most upright and it announceth tobelieverswho do the things that are right that for them is a great reward and that for those who believe not in the life to come we have got ready apainful punishment man prayeth for evil as he prayeth for good for man is hasty we have made the night and the day for two signs the sign of the night do weobscure but the sign of the day cause we to shine forth that ye may seekplenty from your lord and that ye may know the number of the years and thereckoning of time and we have made everything distinct by distinctiveness and every man s fate have we fastened about his neck and on the day ofresurrection will we bring forth to him a book which shall be proffered tohim wide open read thy book there needeth none but thyself to make out an accountagainst thee this day for his own good only shall the guided yield to guidance and to his own lossonly shall the erring err and the heavy laden shall not be laden withanother s load we never punished until we had first sent an apostle and when we willed to destroy a city to its affluent ones did we address ourbidding but when they acted criminally therein just was its doom and wedestroyed it with an utter destruction and since noah how many nations have we exterminated and of the sins of hisservants thy lord is sufficiently informed observant whoso chooseth this quickly passing life quickly will we bestow therein thatwhich we please even on him we choose afterward we will appoint hell forhim in which he shall burn disgraced outcast but whoso chooseth the next life and striveth after it as it should bestriven for being also a believer these their striving shall be gratefulto god to all both to these and those will we prolong the gifts of thy lord for notto any shall the gifts of thy lord be denied see how we have caused some of them to excel others but the next life shallbe greater in its grades and greater in excellence set not up another god with god lest thou sit thee down disgraced helpless thy lord hath ordained that ye worship none but him and kindness to yourparents whether one or both of them attain to old age with thee and say notto them fie neither reproach them but speak to them both with respectfulspeech and defer humbly to them out of tenderness and say lord have compassionon them both even as they reared me when i was little your lord well knoweth what is in your souls he knoweth whether ye berighteous and gracious is he to those who return to him and to him who is of kin render his due and also to the poor and to thewayfarer yet waste not wastefully for the wasteful are brethren of the satans and satan was ungrateful to hislord but if thou turn away from them while thou thyself seekest boons from thylord for which thou hopest at least speak to them with kindly speech and let not thy hand be tied up to thy neck nor yet open it with allopenness lest thou sit thee down in rebuke in beggary verily thy lord will provide with open hand for whom he pleaseth and willbe sparing his servants doth he scan inspect kill not your children for fear of want for them and for you will weprovide verily the killing them is a great wickedness have nought to do with adultery for it is a foul thing and an evil way neither slay any one whom god hath forbidden you to slay unless for a justcause and whosoever shall be slain wrongfully to his heir have we givenpowers but let him not outstep bounds in putting the manslayer to death forhe too in his turn will be assisted and avenged and touch not the substance of the orphan unless in an upright way till heattain his age of strength and perform your covenant verily the covenantshall be enquired of and give full measure when you measure and weigh with just balance thiswill be better and fairest for settlement and follow not that of which thou hast no knowledge because the hearingand the sight and the heart each of these shall be enquired of and walk not proudly on the earth for thou canst not cleave the earth neither shalt thou reach to the mountains in height all this is evil odious to thy lord this is a part of the wisdom which thy lord hath revealed to thee set not upany other god with god lest thou be cast into hell rebuked cast away what hath your lord prepared sons for you and taken for himself daughtersfrom among the angels indeed ye say a dreadful saying moreover for man s warning have we varied this koran yet it onlyincreaseth their flight from it say if as ye affirm there were other gods with him they would in thatcase seek occasion against the occupant of the throne glory to him immensely high is he exalted above their blasphemies the seven heavens praise him and the earth and all who are therein neither is there aught which doth not celebrate his praise but theirutterances of praise ye understand not he is kind indulgent when thou recitest the koran we place between thee and those who believe notin the life to come a dark veil and we put coverings over their hearts lest they should understand it and intheir ears a heaviness and when in the koran thou namest thy one lord they turn their backs inflight we well know why they hearken when they hearken unto thee and when theywhisper apart when the wicked say ye follow no other than a manenchanted see what likenesses they strike out for thee but they are in error neithercan they find the path they also say after we shall have become bones and dust shall we in soothbe raised a new creation say yes though ye were stones or iron or any other creature to yourseeming yet harder to be raised but they will say who shall bring usback say he who created you at first and they will wag their heads atthee and say when shall this be say haply it is nigh on that day shall god call you forth and ye shall answer by praising him and ye shall seem to have tarried but a little while enjoin my servants to speak in kindly sort verily satan would stir upstrifes among them for satan is man s avowed foe your lord well knoweth you if he please he will have mercy on you or if heplease he will chastise you and we have not sent thee to be a guardian overthem thy lord hath full knowledge of all in the heavens and the earth highergifts have we given to some of the prophets than to others and the psalterwe gave to david say call ye upon those whom ye fancy to be gods beside him yet they willhave no power to relieve you from trouble or to shift it elsewhere those whom ye call on themselves desire union with their lord strivingwhich of them shall be nearest to him they also hope for his mercy and fearhis chastisement verily the chastisement of thy lord is to be dreaded there is no city which we will not destroy before the day of resurrection orchastise it with a grievous chastisement this is written in the book nothing hindered us from sending thee with the power of working miracles except that the peoples of old treated them as lies we gave to themoud theshe camel before their very eyes yet they maltreated her we send not aprophet with miracles but to strike terror and remember when we said to thee verily thy lord is round about mankind we ordained the vision which we shewed thee and likewise the cursed treeof the koran only for men to dispute of we will strike them with terror but it shall only increase in them enormous wickedness and when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam and theyall prostrated them save eblis what said he shall i bow me before himwhom thou hast created of clay seest thou this man whom thou hast honoured above me verily if thou respiteme till the day of resurrection i will destroy his offspring except a few he said begone but whosoever of them shall follow thee verily hell shallbe your recompense an ample recompense and entice such of them as thou canst by thy voice assault them with thyhorsemen and thy footmen be their partner in their riches and in theirchildren and make them promises but satan shall make them only deceitfulpromises as to my servants no power over them shalt thou have and thy lord will betheir sufficient guardian it is your lord who speedeth onward the ships for you in the sea that ye mayseek of his abundance for he is merciful towards you when a misfortune befalleth you out at sea they whom ye invoke are not to befound god alone is there yet when he bringeth you safe to dry land yeplace yourselves at a distance from him ungrateful is man what are ye sure then that he will not cleave the sides of the earth foryou or that he will not send against you a whirlwind charged with sands then shall ye find no protector or are ye sure that he will not cause you to put back to sea a second time and send against you a storm blast and drown you for that ye have beenthankless then shall ye find no helper against us therein and now have we honoured the children of adam by land and by sea have wecarried them food have we provided for them of good things and withendowments beyond many of our creatures have we endowed them one day we will summon all men with their leaders they whose book shall begiven into their right hand shall read their book and not be wronged athread and he who has been blind here shall be blind hereafter and wander yet morefrom the way and verily they had well nigh beguiled thee from what we revealed to thee and caused thee to invent some other thing in our name but in that case theywould surely have taken thee as a friend and had we not settled thee thou hadst well nigh leaned to them a little in that case we would surely have made thee taste of woe in life and of woein death then thou shouldest not have found a helper against us and truly they had almost caused thee to quit the land in order wholly todrive thee forth from it but then themselves should have tarried but alittle after thee this was our way with the apostles we have already sent before thee and inthis our way thou shalt find no change observe prayer at sunset till the first darkening of the night and thedaybreak reading for the daybreak reading hath its witnesses and watch unto it in the night this shall be an excess in service it maybe that thy lord will raise thee to a glorious station and say o my lord cause me to enter with a perfect entry and to comeforth with a perfect forthcoming and give me from thy presence a helpingpower and say truth is come and falsehood is vanished verily falsehood is athing that vanisheth and we send down of the koran that which is a healing and a mercy to thefaithful but it shall only add to the ruin of the wicked when we bestow favours on man he withdraweth and goeth aside but when eviltoucheth him he is despairing say every one acteth after his own manner but your lord well knoweth who isbest guided in his path and they will ask thee of the spirit say the spirit proceedeth at mylord s command but of knowledge only a little to you is given if we pleased we could take away what we have revealed to thee none couldstthou then find thee to undertake thy cause with us save as a mercy from thy lord great verily is his favour towards thee say verily were men and djinn assembled to produce the like of this koran they could not produce its like though the one should help the other and of a truth we have set out to men every kind of similitude in this koran but most men have refused everything except unbelief and they say by no means will we believe on thee till thou cause a fountainto gush forth for us from the earth or till thou have a garden of palm trees and grapes and thou cause forth gushing rivers to gush forth in its midst or thou make the heaven to fall on us as thou hast given out in pieces orthou bring god and the angels to vouch for thee or thou have a house of gold or thou mount up into heaven nor will webelieve in thy mounting up till thou send down to us a book which we mayread say praise be to my lord am i more than a man an apostle and what hindereth men from believing when the guidance hath come to them but that they say hath god sent a man as an apostle say did angels walk the earth as its familiars we had surely sent them anangel apostle out of heaven say god is witness enough between you and me his servants he scanneth eyeth and he whom god shall guide will be guided indeed and whom he shall misleadthou shalt find none to assist but him and we will gather them together onthe day of the resurrection on their faces blind and dumb and deaf hellshall be their abode so oft as its fires die down we will rekindle theflame this shall be their reward for that they believed not our signs and said when we shall have become bones and dust shall we surely be raised a newcreation do they not perceive that god who created the heavens and the earth is ableto create their like and he hath ordained them a term there is no doubt ofit but the wicked refuse everything except unbelief say if ye held the treasures of my lord s mercy ye would certainly refrainfrom them through fear of spending them for man is covetous we therefore gave to moses nine clear signs ask thou therefore thechildren of israel how it was when he came unto them and pharaoh said tohim verily i deem thee o moses a man enchanted said moses thou knowest that none hath sent down these clear signs but thelord of the heavens and of the earth and i surely deem thee o pharaoh aperson lost so pharaoh sought to drive them out of the land but we drowned him and allhis followers and after his death we said to the children of israel dwell ye in theland and when the promise of the next life shall come to pass we willbring you both up together to judgment in truth have we sent down the koran and in truth hath it descended and we have only sent thee to announce and towarn and we have parcelled out the koran into sections that thou mightest reciteit unto men by slow degrees and we have sent it down piecemeal say believe ye therein or believe ye not they verily to whom knowledge hadbeen given previously fall on their faces worshipping when it is recited tothem and say glory be to god the promise of our lord is made good they fall down on their faces weeping and it increaseth their humility say call upon god allah or call upon the god of mercy arrahman bywhichsoever ye will invoke him he hath most excellent names and be not loudin thy prayer neither pronounce it too low but between these follow amiddle way and say praise be to god who hath not begotten a son who hath no partner inthe kingdom nor any protector on account of weakness and magnify him

jerusalem and thence through the seven heavens to the throne of god onthe back of borak accompanied by gabriel according to some traditions while others and those too of early date regard it as no more than avision it was however in all probability a dream muir ii nöld p who give the muhammadan sources of information it is probable that as this verse has no real or apparent connection withthe

this isplain magic and though in their souls they knew them to be true yet in their wickednessand pride they denied them but see what was the end of the corrupt doers and of old we gave knowledge to david and solomon and they said praise beto god who hath made us to excel many of his believing servants and in knowledge solomon was david s heir and he said o men we have beentaught the speech of birds and are endued with everything this is indeed aclear boon from god and to solomon were gathered his hosts of djinn and men and birds and theywere marched on in bands till they reached the valley of ants said an ant o ye ants enter yourdwellings lest solomon and his army crush you and know it not then smiled solomon laughing at her words and he said stir me up o lord to be thankful for thy favour which thou hast shewed upon me and upon myparents and to do righteousness that shall be well pleasing to thee andbring me in by thy mercy among thy servants the righteous and he reviewed the birds and said how is it that i see not the lapwing is it one of the absent surely with a severe chastisement will i chastise it or i will certainlyslaughter it unless it bring me a clear excuse nor tarried it long ere it came and said i have gained the knowledge thatthou knowest not and with sure tidings have i come to thee from saba i found a woman reigning over them gifted with everything and she hath asplendid throne and i found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of god and satanhath made their works fair seeming to them so that he hath turned them fromthe way wherefore they are not guided to the worship of god who bringeth to light the secret things of heaven andearth and knoweth what men conceal and what they manifest god there is no god but he the lord of the glorious throne he said we shall see whether thou hast spoken truth or whether thou art ofthem that lie go with this my letter and throw it down to them then turn away from themand await their answer she said o my nobles an honourable letter hath been thrown down to me it is from solomon and it is this in the name of god the compassionate the merciful set not up yourselves against me but come to me submitting muslims she said o my nobles advise me in mine affair i decide it not withoutyour concurrence they said we are endued with strength and are endued with mighty valour but to command is thine see therefore what thou wilt command us she said kings when they enter a city spoil it and abase the mightiest ofits people and in like manner will these also do but i will send to them with a gift and await what my envoys bring back and when the messenger came to solomon he said aid ye me with riches butwhat god hath given to me is better than what he hath given you yet ye gloryin your gifts return to them for we will surely come to them with forces which they cannotwithstand and we will drive them from their land humbled and contemptible said he o nobles which of you will bring me her throne before they come tome submitting muslims an efreet of the djinn said i will bring it thee ere thou risest from thyplace i have power for this and am trusty and one who had the knowledge of scripture said i will bring it to thee inthe twinkling of an eye and when he saw it set before him he said thisis of the favour of my lord to try me whether i will be thankful orunthankful and he who is thankful is thankful to his own behoof and as forhim who is unthankful truly my lord is self sufficient bounteous said he make her throne so that she know it not we shall see whether shehath or not guidance and when she came he said is thy throne like this she said as though itwere the same and we said he have had knowledge given us before her and have been muslims but the gods she had worshipped instead of god had led her astray for shewas of a people who believe not it was said to her enter the palace and when she saw it she thought it alake of water and bared her legs he said it is a palace paved withglass she said o my lord i have sinned against my own soul and i resign myself with solomon to god the lord of the worlds and of old we sent to themoud their brother saleh with serve ye god butlo they became two sets of disputants wrangling with each other he said o my people why if ye ask not pardon of god that ye may findmercy hasten ye on evil rather than good they said we augur ill concerning thee and those who are with thee hesaid the ills of which ye augur depend on god but ye are a people onyour trial and there were in the city nine persons who committed excesses in the landand did not that which is right they said swear ye to one another by god that we will surely fall on himand on his family by night then will be say to the avenger of blood wewitnessed not the destruction of his family and verily we speak the truth and they devised a device and we devised a device and they were not awareof it and see what was the end of their device we destroyed them and their wholepeople and for their sin these their houses are empty ruins verily in this is asign to those who understand and we delivered those who believed and feared and lot when he said to his people what proceed ye to such filthinesswith your eyes open what come ye with lust unto men rather than to women surely ye are anignorant people and the answer of his people was but to say cast out the family of lot fromyour city they forsooth are men of purity so we rescued him and his family but as for his wife we decreed her to beof them that lingered and we rained a rain upon them and fatal was the rain to those who had hadtheir warning say praise be to god and peace be on his servants whom he hath chosen isgod the more worthy or the gods they join with him is not he who hath made the heavens and the earth and hath sent down rain toyou from heaven by which we cause the luxuriant groves to spring up it isnot in your power to cause its trees to spring up what a god with god yetthey find equals for him is not he who hath set the earth so firm and hath made rivers in its midst and hath placed mountains upon it and put a barrier between the two seas what a god with god yet the greater part of them have no knowledge is not he the more worthy who answereth the oppressed when they cry to him and taketh off their ills and maketh you to succeed your sires on the earth what a god with god how few bear these things in mind is not he who guideth you in the darkness of the land and of the sea andwho sendeth forth the winds as the forerunners of his mercy what a god withgod far from god be what ye join with him is not he who created a being then reneweth it and who supplieth you outof the heaven and the earth what a god with god say bring forth yourproofs if you speak the truth say none either in the heavens or in the earth knoweth the unseen but god and they know notwhen they shall be raised yet they have attained to a knowledge of the life to come yet are they indoubt about it yet are they blind about it and the unbelievers say when we and our fathers have been dead shall we betaken forth of old have we been promised this we and our sires of old it is but fablesof the ancients say go ye through the land and see what hath been the end of the wicked and grieve not thou for them nor be in distress at their devisings and they say when will this promise be made good if ye speak true say haply a part of what ye desire to be hastened may be close behind you and truly thy lord is full of goodness towards men but most of them are notthankful and thy lord knoweth well what their breasts enshroud and what they bring tolight and there is no secret thing in the heaven or on the earth but it is in theclear book truly this koran declareth to the children of israel most things wherein theydisagree and it is certainly guidance and a mercy to the faithful verily by his wisdom will thy lord decide between them for he is themighty the knowing put thou then thy trust in god for thou hast clear truth on thy side thou shalt not make the dead to hear neither shalt thou make the deaf tohear the call when they turn away backward neither art thou the guide of the blind out of their errors none truly shaltthou make to hear but those who believe our signs and they are muslims when the doom shall be ready to light upon them we will cause a monster tocome forth to them out of the earth and cry to them verily men have notfirmly believed our signs and on that day shall be gathered out of every nation a company of those whohave gainsaid our signs in separate bands till they come before god who will say treated ye my signs as impostures although ye embraced them not in your knowledge or what is it that ye weredoing and doom shall light upon them for their evil deeds and nought shall theyhave to plead see they not that we have ordained the night that they may rest in it andthe day with its gift of light of a truth herein are signs to people whobelieve on that day there shall be a blast on the trumpet and all that are in theheavens and all that the on the earth shall be terror stricken save himwhom god pleaseth to deliver and all shall come to him in humble guise and thou shalt see the mountains which thou thinkest so firm pass away withthe passing of a cloud tis the work of god who ordereth all things of allthat ye do is he well aware to him who shall present himself with good works shall be a reward beyondtheir desert and they shall be secure from the terror on that day and they who shall present themselves with evil shall be flung downward ontheir faces into the fire shall ye be rewarded but as ye have wrought say specially am i commanded to worship the lord of this land which he hathsanctified all things are his and i am commanded to be one of those whosurrender them to god a muslim and to recite the koran and whoever is rightly guided assuredly will berightly guided to his own behoof and as to him who erreth say i

than a lie and haply if they believe not in this new revelation thou wilt slaythyself on their very footsteps out of vexation verily we have made all that is on earth as its adornment that we mightmake trial who among mankind would excel in works but we are surely about to reduce all that is thereon to dust hast thou reflected that the inmates of the cave and of al rakim were on ourwondrous signs when the youths betook them to the cave they said o our lord grant usmercy from before thee and order for us our affair aright then struck we upon their ears with deafness in the cave for many a year then we awaked them that we might know which of the two parties could bestreckon the space of their abiding we will relate to thee their tale with truth they were youths who hadbelieved in their lord and in guidance had we increased them and we had made them stout of heart when they stood up and said our lordis lord of the heavens and of the earth we will call on no other god thanhim for in that case we had said a thing outrageous these our people have taken other gods beside him though they bring no clearproof for them but who more iniquitous than he who forgeth a lie of god so when ye shall have separated you from them and from that which theyworship beside god then betake you to the cave your lord will unfold hismercy to you and will order your affairs for you for the best and thou mightest have seen the sun when it arose pass on the right of theircave and when it set leave them on the left while they were in itsspacious chamber this is one of the signs of god guided indeed is he whomgod guideth but for him whom he misleadeth thou shalt by no means find apatron director and thou wouldst have deemed them awake though they were sleeping and weturned them to the right and to the left and in the entry lay their dog withpaws outstretched hadst thou come suddenly upon them thou wouldst surelyhave turned thy back on them in flight and have been filled with fear atthem so we awaked them that they might question one another said one of them how long have ye tarried here they said we have tarried a day or part ofday they said your lord knoweth best how long ye have tarried send nowone of you with this your coin into the city and let him mark who thereinhath purest food and from him let him bring you a supply and let him becourteous and not discover you to any one for they if they find you out will stone you or turn you back to theirfaith and in that case it will fare ill with you for ever and thus made we their adventure known to their fellow citizens that theymight learn that the promise of god is true and that as to the hour thereis no doubt of its coming when they disputed among themselves concerningwhat had befallen them some said build a building over them their lordknoweth best about them those who prevailed in the matter said a place ofworship will we surely raise over them some say they were three their dog the fourth others say five theirdog the sixth guessing at the secret others say seven and their dog theeighth say my lord best knoweth the number none save a few shall knowthem therefore be clear in they discussions about them and ask not any christianconcerning them say not thou of a thing i will surely do it to morrow without if godwill and when thou hast forgotten call thy lord to mind and say haplymy lord will guide me that i may come near to the truth of this story withcorrectness and they tarried in their cave years and years over say god best knoweth how long they tarried with him are the secrets of theheavens and of the earth look thou and hearken unto him alone man hath noguardian but him and none may bear part in his judgments and publish what hath been revealed to thee of the book of thy lord none maychange his words and thou shalt find no refuge beside him be patient with those who call upon their lord at morn and even seeking hisface and let not thine eyes be turned away from them in quest of the pomp ofthis life neither obey him whose heart we have made careless of theremembrance of us and who followeth his own lusts and whose ways areunbridled and say the truth is from your lord let him then who will believe and lethim who will be an infidel but for the offenders we have got ready the firewhose smoke shall enwrap them and if they implore help helped shall they bewith water like molten brass which shall scald their wretched the drink andan unhappy couch but as to those who have believed and done the things that are right verilywe will not suffer the reward of him whose works were good to perish for them the gardens of eden under whose shades shall rivers flow deckedshall they be therein with bracelets of gold and green robes of silk andrich brocade shall they wear reclining them therein on thrones blissful thereward and a pleasant couch and set forth to them as a parable two men on one of whom we bestowed twogardens of grape vines and surrounded both with palm trees and placed cornfields between them each of the gardens did yield its fruit and failed notthereof at all and we caused a river to flow in their midst and this man received hisfruit and said disputing with him to his companion more have i than thouof wealth and my family is mightier and he went into his garden to his own soul unjust he said i do not thinkthat this will ever perish and i do not think that the hour will come and even if i be taken back tomy lord i shall surely find a better than it in exchange his fellow said to him disputing with him what hast thou no belief inhim who created thee of the dust then of the germs of life then fashionedthee a perfect man but god is my lord and no other being will i associate with my lord and why didst thou not say when thou enteredst thy garden what god willeth there is no power but in god though thou seest that i have less than thouof wealth and children yet haply my lord may bestow on me better than thy garden and may send hisbolts upon it out of heaven so that the next dawn shall find it barren dust or its water become deep sunk so that thou art unable to find it and his fruits were encompassed by destruction then began he to turn downthe palms of his hands at what he had spent on it for its vines were fallingdown on their trellises and he said oh that i had not joined any other godto my lord and he had no host to help him instead of god neither was he able to helphimself protection in such a case is of god the truth he is the best rewarder andhe bringeth to the best issue and set before them a similitude of the present life it is as water which wesend down from heaven and the herb of the earth is mingled with it and onthe morrow it becometh dry stubble which the winds scatter for god hathpower over all things wealth and children are the adornment of this present life but good works which are lasting are better in the sight of thy lord as to recompense andbetter as to hope and call to mind the day when we will cause the mountains to pass away andthou shalt see the earth a levelled plain and we will gather mankindtogether and not leave of them any one and they shall be set before thy lord in ranks now are ye come unto us aswe created you at first but ye thought that we should not make good to youthe promise and each shall have his book put into his hand and thou shalt see the wickedin alarm at that which is therein and they shall say o woe to us whatmeaneth this book it leaveth neither small nor great unnoted down and theyshall find all that they have wrought present to them and thy lord will notdeal unjustly with any one when we said to the angels prostrate yourselves before adam they allprostrated them save eblis who was of the djinn and revolted from hislord s behest behest what will ye then take him and his offspring aspatrons rather than me and they your enemies sad exchange for the ungodly i made them not witnesses of the creation of the heavens and of the earth nor of their own creation neither did i take seducers as my helpers on a certain day god shall say call ye on the companions ye joined withme deeming them to be gods and they shall call on them but they shall notanswer them then will we place a valley of perdition between them and the wicked shall see the fire and shall have a foreboding that theyshall be flung into it and they shall find no escape from it and now in this koran we have presented to man similitudes of every kind but at most things is man a caviller and what now that guidance is come to them letteth men from believing andfrom asking forgiveness of their lord unless they wait till that the doom ofthe ancients overtake them or the chastisement come upon them in the sightof the universe we send not our sent ones but to announce and to warn but the infidels cavilwith vain words in order to refute the truth and they treat my signs andtheir own warnings with scorn but who is worse than he who when told of the signs of his lord turneth himaway and forgetteth what in time past his hands have wrought truly we havethrown veils over their hearts lest they should understand this koran andinto their ears a heaviness and if thou bid them to the guidance yet will they not even then be guidedever the gracious one full of compassion is thy lord if he would have chastisedthem for their demerits he would have hastened their chastisement but theyhave a time fixed for the accomplishment of our menaces and beside god theyshall find no refuge and those cities did we destroy when they became impious and of their comingdestruction we gave them warning remember when moses said to his servant i will not stop till i reach theconfluence of the two seas or for years will i journey on but when they reached their confluence they forgot their fish and it tookits way in the sea at will and when they had passed on said moses to his servant bring us our morningmeal for now have we incurred weariness from this journey he said what thinkest thou when we repaired to the rock for rest i forgotthe fish and none but satan made me forget it so as not to mention it andit hath taken its way in the sea in a wondrous sort he said it is this we were in quest of and they both went backretracing their footsteps then found they one of our servants to whom we had vouchsafed our mercy andwhom we had instructed with our knowledge and moses said to him shall i follow thee that thou teach me for guidance of that which thou too hast been taught he said verily thou canst not have patience with me how canst thou be patient in matters whose meaning thou comprehendest not he said thou shalt find me patient if god please nor will i disobey thybidding he said then if thou follow me ask me not of aught until i have giventhee an account thereof so they both went on till they embarked in a ship and he the unknown stavedit in what said moses hast thou staved it in that thou mayest drown itscrew a strange thing now hast thou done he said did i not tell thee that thou couldst not have patience with me he said chide me not that i forgat nor lay on me a hard command then went they on till they met a youth and he slew him said moses hastthou slain him who is free from guilt of blood now hast thou wrought agrievous thing he said did i not tell thee that thou couldst not have patience with me moses said if after this i ask thee aught then let me be thy comrade nolonger but now hast thou my excuse they went on till they came to the people of a city of this people theyasked food but they refused them for guests and they found in it a wallthat was about to fall and he set it upright said moses if thou hadstwished for this thou mightest have obtained pay he said this is the parting point between me and thee but i will firsttell thee the meaning of that which thou couldst not await with patience as to the vessel it belonged to poor men who toiled upon the sea and i wasminded to damage it for in their rear was a king who seized every ship byforce as to the youth his parents were believers and we feared lest he shouldtrouble them by error and infidelity and we desired that their lord might give them in his place a child betterthan he in virtue and nearer to filial piety and as to the wall it belonged to two orphan youths in the city and beneathit was their treasure and their father was a righteous man and thy lorddesired that they should reach the age of strength and take forth theirtreasure through the mercy of thy lord and not of mine own will have i donethis this is the interpretation of that which thou couldst not bear withpatience they will ask thee of dhoulkarnain the two horned say i will recite toyou an account of him we stablished his power upon the earth and made for him a way to everything and a route he followed until when he reached the setting of the sun he found it to set in a miryfount and hard by he found a people we said o dhoulkarnain either chastise or treat them generously the impious said he will we surely chastise then shall he be takenback to his lord and he will chastise him with a grievous chastisement but as to him who believeth and doeth that which is right he shall have agenerous recompense and we will lay on them our easy behests then followed he a route until when he reached the rising of the sun he found it to rise on a peopleto whom we had given no shelter from it thus it was and we had full knowledge of the forces that were with him then followed he a routeuntil he came between the two mountains beneath which he found a people whoscarce understood a language they said o dhoulkarnain verily gog and magog waste this land shall wethen pay thee tribute so thou build a rampart between us and them he said better than your tribute is the might wherewith my lord hathstrengthened me but help me strenuously and i will set a barrier betweenyou and them bring me blocks of iron until when it filled the space between the mountainsides ply said he your bellows until when he had made it red with heat fire he said bring me molten brass that i may pour upon it and gog and magog were not able to scale it neither were they able to digthrough it this said he is a mercy from my lord but when the promise of my lord shall come to pass he will turn it to dust and the promise of my lord is true on that day we will let them dash like billows one over another and thereshall be a blast on the trumpet and we will gather them together in a body and we will set hell on that day close before the infidels whose eyes were veiled from my warning and who had no power to hear what do the infidels think that they can take my servants as their patrons beside me verily we have got hell ready as the abode of the infidels say shall we tell you who they are that have lost their labour most whose aim in the present life hath been mistaken and who deem that what theydo is right they are those who believe not in the signs of the lord or that they shallever meet him vain therefore are their works and no weight will we allowthem on the day of resurrection this shall be their reward hell because they were unbelievers and treatedmy signs and my apostles with scorn but as for those who believe and do the things that are right they shallhave the gardens of paradise for their abode they shall remain therein for ever they shall wish for no change from it say should the sea become ink to write the words of my lord the sea wouldsurely fail ere the words of my lord would fail though we brought its likein aid say in sooth

seeing and hearts what little thanks do ye return and they say what when we shall have lain hidden in the earth shall webecome a new creation yea they deny that they shall meet their lord say the angel of death who is charged with you shall cause you to die thenshall ye be returned to your lord couldst thou but see when the guilty shall droop their heads before theirlord and cry o our lord we have seen and we have heard return us then tolife we will do that which is right verily we believe firmly had we pleased we had certainly given to every soul its guidance but trueshall be the word which hath gone forth from me i will surely fill hell withdjinn and men together taste then the recompense of your having forgotten the meeting with thisyour day we too we have forgotten you taste then an eternal punishmentfor that which ye have wrought they only believe in our signs who when mention is made of them fall downin adoration and celebrate the praise of their lord and are not puffed upwith disdain who as they raise them from their couches call on their lord with fear anddesire and give alms of that with which we have supplied them no soul knoweth what joy of the eyes is reserved for the good in recompenseof their works shall he then who is a believer be as he who sinneth grossly they shall notbe held alike as to those who believe and do that which is right they shall have gardensof eternal abode as the meed of their works but as for those who grossly sin their abode shall be the fire so oft asthey shall desire to escape out of it back shall they be turned into it andit shall be said to them taste ye the torment of the fire which ye treatedas a lie and we will surely cause them to taste a punishment yet nearer at hand besides the greater punishment that haply they may turn to us in penitence who acteth worse than he who is warned by the signs of his lord then turnethaway from them we will surely take vengeance on the guilty ones we heretofore gave the book of the law to moses have thou no doubt as to ourmeeting with him and we appointed it for the guidance of the children ofisrael and we appointed imâms from among them who should guide after our commandwhen they had themselves endured with constancy and had firmly believed inour signs now thy lord he will decide between them on the day of resurrection as tothe subject of their disputes is it

with warnings but most of themwithdraw and hearken not and they say our hearts are under shelter from thy teachings and in ourears is a deafness and between us and thee there is a veil act as thouthinkest right we verily shall act as we think right say i am only a man like you it is revealed to me that your god is onegod go straight then to him and implore his pardon and woe to those whojoin gods with god who pay not the alms of obligation and in the life to come believe not but they who believe and do the things that are right shall receive aperfect recompense say do ye indeed disbelieve in him who in two days created the earth and doye assign him peers the lord of the worlds is he and he hath placed on the earth the firm mountains which tower above it andhe hath blessed it and distributed food throughout it for the cravings ofall alike in four days then he applied himself to the heaven which then was but smoke and to itand to the earth he said come ye whether in obedience or against yourwill and they both said we come obedient and he made them seven heavens in two days and in each heaven made known itsoffice and we furnished the lower heaven with lights and guardian angels this the disposition of the almighty the all knowing if they turn away then say i warn you of a tempest like the tempest of adand themoud when the apostles came to them on every side saying worship none butgod they said had our lord been pleased to send down he had surely sentdown angels and in sooth your message we do not believe as to ad they bore them proudly and unjustly in the land and said whomore mighty than we in prowess saw they not that god their creator wasmightier than they in prowess and they rejected our signs therefore on ill omened days did we send against them an impetuous blast thatwe might make them taste the chastisement of shame in this world but moreshameful shall be the chastisement of the life to come and they shall not beprotected and as to themoud we had vouchsafed them guidance but to guidance did theyprefer blindness wherefore the tempest of a shameful punishment overtookthem for their doings but we rescued the believing and the god fearing and warn of the day when the enemies of god shall be gathered unto the fireurged on in bands until when they reach it their ears and their eyes and their skins shallbear witness against them of their deeds and they shall say to their skins why witness ye against us they shallsay god who giveth a voice to all things hath given us a voice hecreated you at first and to him are ye brought back and ye did not hide yourselves so that neither your ears nor your eyes noryour skins should witness against you but ye thought that god knew not manya thing that ye did and this your thought which ye did think of your lord hath ruined you sothat ye are become of those who perish and be they patient still the fire shall be their abode or if they beg forfavour yet shall they not be of favoured and we will appoint satans as their fast companions for it was they who madetheir present and future state seem fair and right to them and the sentencepassed on the peoples of djinn and men who flourished before them hath becometheir due and they shall perish yet the unbelievers say hearken not to this koran but keep up a talking that ye may overpower the voice of the reader surely therefore will we cause the unbelievers to taste a terriblepunishment and recompense them according to the worst of their actions this the reward of the enemies of god the fire it shall be their eternalabode in requital for their gainsaying our signs and they who believed not shall say o our lord shew us those of the djinnand men who led us astray both of them will we put under out feet that theymay be of the humbled but as for those who say our lord is god and who go straight to him angels shall descend to them and say fear ye not neither be ye grieved but rejoice ye in the paradise which ye have been promised we are your guardians in this life and in the next your s therein shall beyour soul s desire and your s therein whatever ye shall ask for the hospitality of a gracious a merciful one and who speaketh fairer than he who biddeth to god and doth the thing that isright and saith i for my part am of the muslims moreover good and evil are not to be treated as the same thing turn awayevil by what is better and lo he between whom and thyself was enmity shallbe as though he were a warm friend but none attain to this save men steadfast in patience and none attain to itexcept the most highly favoured and if an enticement from satan entice thee then take refuge in god for heis the hearing the knowing and among his signs are the night and the day and the sun and the moon bend not in adoration to the sun or the moon but bend in adoration beforegod who created them both if ye would serve him but if they are too proud for this yet they who are with thy lord docelebrate his praises night and day and cease not and among his signs is this that thou seest the earth drooping but when wesend down the rain upon it it is stirred and swelleth verily he who givethit life will surely give life to the dead for his might extendeth over allthings they truly who with obloquy disown our signs are not hidden from us is hethen who shall be cast into the fire or he who shall come forth secure onthe day of resurrection in the better position do what ye will but his eyeis on all your doings verily they who believe not in the warning after it hath come to them and yet the koran is a glorious book falsehood from whatever side it cometh shall not come night it it is amissive down from the wise the praiseworthy nothing hath been said to thee which hath not been said of old to apostlesbefore thee verily with thy lord is forgiveness and with him is terribleretribution had we made it a koran in a foreign tongue they had surely said unless itssigns be made clear what in a foreign tongue and the peoplearabian say it is to those who believe a guide and a medicine but as tothose who believe not there is a thickness in their ears and to them it isa blindness they are like those who are called to from afar of old we gave the book to moses and disputes arose about it and if adecree of respite from thy lord had gone before there would surely have beena decision between them for great were their doubts and questionings aboutit he who doth right it is for himself and he who doth evil it is forhimself and thy lord will not deal unfairly with his servants with him alone is the knowledge of the hour no fruit cometh forth fromits coverings neither doth any female conceive nor is she delivered butwith his knowledge and on that day he shall call men to him saying whereare the companions ye gave me they shall say we own to thee there is noone of us can witness for them and what they erst called on shall pass away from them and they shallperceive that there will be no escape for them man ceaseth not to pray for good but if evil betide him he despondeth despairing and if we cause him to taste our mercy after affliction hath touched him heis sure to say this is my due and i take no thought of the hour ofresurrection and if i be brought back to my lord i shall indeed attain withhim my highest good but we will then certainly declare their doings to theinfidels and cause them to taste a stern punishment when we are gracious to man he withdraweth and turneth him aside but whenevil toucheth him he is a man of long prayers say what think ye if this book be from god and ye believe it not who willhave gone further astray than he who is at a distance from it we will shew them our signs in different countries and among themselves until it become plain to them that it is the truth is it not enough for theethat thy lord is witness of all things are they not in doubt as to the meeting with their lord but doth he notencompass all things in some mss this sura

abroad aresigns to the firm in faith and in the succession of night and day and in the supply which god sendethdown from the heaven whereby he giveth life to the earth when dead and inthe change of the winds are signs for a people of discernment such are the signs of god with truth do we recite them to thee but in whatteaching will they believe if they reject god and his signs woe to every lying sinner who heareth the signs of god recited to him and then as though he heardthem not persisteth in proud disdain apprise him of an afflictivepunishment and when he becometh acquainted with any of our signs he turneth them intoridicule these a shameful punishment for them hell is behind them and neither their gains nor the lords whom they haveadopted beside god shall avail them in the least and theirs a greatpunishment this is guidance and for those who disbelieve the signs of their lord isthe punishment of an afflictive torment it is god who hath subjected the sea to you that the ships may traverse it athis bidding and that ye may go in quest of the gifts of his bounty and thatye may be thankful and he hath subjected to you all that is in the heavens and all that is onthe earth all is from him verily herein are signs for those who reflect tell the believers to pardon those who hope not for the days of god in whichhe purposeth to reward men according to their deeds he who doth that which is right doth it to his own behoof and whoso dothevil doth it to his own hurt hereafter to your lord shall ye be broughtback to the children of israel gave we of old the book and the wisdom and thegift of prophecy and we supplied them with good things and privileged themabove all peoples and we gave them clear sanctions for our behests neither did they differ through mutual envy till after they had become possessed of knowledge butthy lord will judge between them on the day of resurrection as to thesubject of their disputes afterwards we set thee over our divine law follow it then and follow notthe wishes of those who have no knowledge for against god shall they avail thee nothing and in sooth the doers ofevil are one another s patrons but the patron of them that fear him is godhimself this book hath insight for mankind and a guidance and mercy to a people whoare firm in faith deem they whose gettings are only evil that we will deal with them as withthose who believe and work righteousness so that their lives and deathsshall be alike ill do they judge in all truth hath god created the heavens and the earth that he may rewardevery one as he shall have wrought and they shall not be wronged what thinkest thou he who hath made a god of his passions and whom godcauseth wilfully to err and whose ears and whose heart he hath sealed up and over whose sight he hath placed a veil who after his rejection by god shall guide such a one will ye not then be warned and they say there is only this our present life we die and we live andnought but time destroyeth us but in this they have no knowledge it ismerely their own conceit and when our clear signs are recited to them their only argument is to say bring back our fathers if ye speak the truth say god giveth you life then causeth you to die then will he assemble youon the day of resurrection there is no doubt of it but most men have notthis knowledge and god s is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and on the day whenthe hour shall arrive on that day shall the despisers perish and thou shalt see every nation kneeling to its own book shall every nationbe summoned this day shall ye be repaid as ye have wrought this our book will speak of you with truth therein have we written downwhatever ye have done as to those who have believed and wrought righteously into his mercy shalltheir lord cause them to enter this shall be undoubted bliss but as to the infidels were not my signs recited to you but ye proudlyscorned them and became a sinful people and when it was said verily the promise of god is truth and as to thehour there is no doubt of it ye said we know not what the hour is weconceive it a mere conceit we have no assurance of it and the evils they have wrought shall rise up into their view and that atwhich they mocked shall hem them in on every side and it shall be said to them this day will we forget you as ye forgat yourmeeting with us this day and your abode shall be the fire and none shallthere be to succour you this because ye received the signs of god with mockery and this presentlife deceived you on that day therefore they shall not come out from it and they shall not

they beseem you well when ye fetch them home and when ye drive themforth to pasture and they carry your burdens to lands which ye could not else reach but withtravail of soul truly your lord is full of goodness and merciful and he hath given you horses mules and asses that ye may ride them andfor your ornament and things of which ye have no knowledge hath he created of god it is to point out the

guidance and way marks by the stars too are men guided shall he then who hath created be as he who hath not created will ye notconsider and if ye would reckon up the favours of god ye could not count them aye god is right gracious merciful and god knoweth what ye conceal and what ye bring to light while the gods whom they call on beside god create nothing but arethemselves created dead are they lifeless and they know notwhen they shall be raised your god is the one god and they who believe not in a future life havehearts given to denial and are men of pride beyond a doubt god knoweth what they conceal and what they manifest he truly loveth not the men of pride for when it is said to them what is this your lord hath sent down theysay fables of the ancients that on the day of resurrection they may bear their own entire burden andthe burden of those whom they in their ignorance misled shall it not be agrievous burden for them they who were before them did plot of old but god attacked their building atits foundation the roof fell on them from above and whence they looked notfor it punishment overtook them on the day of resurrection too will he shame them he will say where arethe gods ye associated with me the subjects of your disputes they to whom the knowledge hath been given will say verily this day shall shame andevil fall upon the infidels the sinners against their own souls whom the angels shall cause to die willproffer the submission no evil have we done nay god knoweth what ye havewrought enter ye therefore the gates of hell to remain therein for ever and horridthe abiding place of the haughty ones but to those who have feared god it shall be said what is this that yourlord hath awarded they shall say that which is best to those who dogood a good reward in this present world but better the mansion of thenext and right pleasant the abode of the god fearing gardens of eden into which they shall enter rivers shall flow beneath theirshades all they wish for shall they find therein thus god rewardeth thosewho fear him to whom as righteous persons the angels shall say when they receive theirsouls peace be on you enter paradise as the meed of your labours what can the infidels expect but that the angels of death come upon them orthat a sentence of thy lord take effect thus did they who flourished beforethem god was not unjust to them but to their ownselves were they unjust and the ill which they had done recoiled upon them and that which they hadscoffed at encompassed them round about they who have joined other gods with god say had he pleased neither we norour fathers had worshipped aught but him nor should we apart from him haveforbidden aught thus acted they who were before them yet is the duty ofthe apostles other than public preaching and to every people have we sent an apostle saying worship god and turn awayfrom taghout some of them there were whom god guided and there were othersdecreed to err but go through the land and see what hath been the end ofthose who treated my apostles as liars if thou art anxious for their guidance know that god will not guide him whomhe would lead astray neither shall they have any helpers and they swear by god with their most sacred oath that god will never raisehim who once is dead nay but on him is a promise binding though most menknow it not that he may clear up to them the subject of their disputes and that theinfidels may know that they are liars our word to a thing when we will it is but to say be and it is and as to those who when oppressed have fled their country for the sake ofgod we will surely provide them a goodly abode in this world but greaterthe reward of the next life did they but know itthey who bear ills with patience and put their trust in the lord none have we sent before thee but men inspired ask of those who have books ofmonition if ye know it not with proofs of their mission and scriptures and to thee have we sent downthis book of monition that thou mayest make clear to men what hath been sentdown to them and that they may ponder it what are they then who have plotted mischiefs sure that god will not causethe earth to cleave under them or that a chastisement will not come uponthem whence they looked not for it or that he will not seize upon them in their comings and goings while theyshall not be able to resist him or that he will not seize them with some slowly wasting scourge but verilyyour lord is good gracious have they not seen how everything which god hath created turneth its shadowright and left prostrating itself before god in all abasement and all in the heavens and all on the earth each thing that moveth and thevery angels prostrate them in adoration before god and are free from pride they fear their lord who is above them and do what they are bidden for god hath said take not to yourselves two gods for he is one god me therefore yea me revere all in the heavens and in the earth is his his due unceasing service willye then fear any other than god and all your blessings are assuredly from god then when trouble befallethyou to him ye turn for help then when he relieveth you of the trouble lo some of you join associateswith your lord to prove how thankless are they for our gifts enjoy yourselves then but inthe end ye shall know the truth and for idols of which they know nothing they set apart a share of ourbounties by god ye shall be called to account for your devices and they ascribe daughters unto god glory be to him but they desire themnot for themselves for when the birth of a daughter is announced to any one of them darkshadows settle on his face and he is sad he hideth him from the people because of the ill tidings shall he keep itwith disgrace or bury it in the dust are not their judgments wrong to whatever is evil may they be likened who believe not in a future life but god is to be likened to whatever is loftiest for he is the mighty thewise should god punish men for their perverse doings he would not leave on eartha moving thing but to an appointed term doth he respite them and when theirterm is come they shall not delay or advance it an hour yet what they loathe themselves do they assign to god and their tonguesutter the lie that theirs shall be a goodly lot but beyond a doubt is itthat the fire awaiteth them and that they shall be the first sent into it by god we have sent apostles to nations before thee but satan prepared theirwork for them and this day is he their liege and a woeful punishment dothawait them and we have sent down the book to thee only that thou mightest clear up tothem the subject of their wranglings and as a guidance and a mercy to thosewho believe and god sendeth down water from heaven and by it giveth life to the earthafter it hath been dead verily in this is a sign to those who hearken ye have also teaching from the cattle we give you drink of the pure milk between dregs and blood which is in their bellies the pleasant beverage ofthem that quaff it and among fruits ye have the palm and the vine from which ye get wine andhealthful nutriment in this verily are signs for those who reflect and thy lord hath taught the bee saying provide thee houses in themountains and in the trees and in the hives which men do build thee feed moreover on every kind of fruit and walk the beaten paths of thylord from its belly cometh forth a fluid of varying hues which yieldethmedicine to man verily in this is a sign for those who consider and god hath created you by and bye will he take you to himself and someamong you will he carry on to abject old age when all that once was known isknown no longer aye god is knowing powerful and god hath abounded to some of you more than to others in the supplies oflife yet they to whom he hath abounded impart not thereof to the slaveswhom their right hands possess so that they may share alike what will theydeny then that these boons are from god god too hath given you wives of your own race and from your wives hath hegiven you sons and grandsons and with good things hath he supplied you what will they then believe in vain idols for god s boons they areungrateful and they worship beside god those who neither out of the heavens or earth canprovide them a particle of food and have no power in themselves make no comparisons therefore with god verily god hath knowledge butye have not god maketh comparison between a slave the property of his lord who hath nopower over anything and a free man whom we have ourselves supplies and whogiveth alms therefrom both in secret and openly shall they be held equal no praise be to god but most men know it not god setteth forth also a comparison between two men one of whom is dumb fromhis birth and hath no power over anything and is a burden to his lord sendhim where he will he cometh not back with success shall he and the man whoenjoineth what is just and keepeth in the straight path be held equal god s are the secrets of the heavens and of the earth and the business ofthe last hour will be but as the twinkling of an eye or even less yes forall things is god potent god hath brought you out of your mothers wombs devoid of all knowledge buthath given you hearing and sight and heart that haply ye might renderthanks have they never looked up at the birds subjected to him in heaven s vault none holdeth them in hand but god in this are signs for those who believe and god hath given you tents to dwell in and he hath given you the skins ofbeasts for tents that ye may find them light when ye shift your quarters orwhen ye halt and from their wool and soft fur and hair hath he supplied youwith furniture and goods for temporary use and from the things which he hath created hath god provided shade for you and hath given you the mountains for places of shelter and hath given yougarments to defend you from the heat and garments to defend you in yourwars thus doth he fill up the measure of his goodness towards you that youmay resign yourselves to him but if they turn their backs still thy office is only plain spokenpreaching they own the goodness of god then they disown it and most of them areinfidels but one day we will raise up a witness out of every nation them shall theinfidels have no permission to make excuses and they shall find no favour and when they who have acted thus wrongly shall behold their torment itshall not be made light to them nor will god deign to look upon them and when they who had joined associates with god shall see those theirassociate gods they shall say o our lord these are our associate godswhom we called upon beside thee but they shall retort on them verily yeare liars and on that day shall they proffer submission to god and the deities oftheir own invention shall vanish from them as for those who were infidels and turned others aside from the way of god to them we will add punishment on punishment for their corrupt doings and one day we will summon up in every people a witness against them fromamong themselves and we will bring thee up as a witness against thesemeccans for to thee have we sent down the book which cleareth up everything a guidance and mercy and glad tidings to those who resign themselves to god to muslims verily god enjoineth justice and the doing of good and gifts to kindred andhe forbiddeth wickedness and wrong and oppression he warneth you that haplyye may be mindful be faithful in the covenant of god when ye have covenanted and break notyour oaths after ye have pledged them for now have ye made god to standsurety for you verily god hath knowledge of what ye do and because you are a more numerous people than some other people be notlike her who unravelleth the thread which she had strongly spun by takingyour oaths with mutual perfidy god is making trial of you in this and inthe day of resurrection he will assuredly clear up to you that concerningwhich ye are now at variance had god pleased he could have made you one people but he causeth whom hewill to err and whom he will he guideth and ye shall assuredly be called toaccount for your doings therefore take not your oaths with mutual fraud lest your foot slip after ithath been firmly fixed and ye taste of evil because ye have turned othersaside from the way of god and great be your punishment and barter not the covenant of god for a mean price for with god is thatwhich is better for you if ye do but understand all that is with you passeth away but that which is with god abideth with areward meet for their best deeds will we surely recompense those who havepatiently endured whoso doeth that which is right whether male or female if a believer himwill we surely quicken to a happy life and recompense them with a rewardmeet for their best deeds when thou readest the koran have recourse to god for help against satan thestoned for no power hath he over those who believe and put their trust in theirlord but only hath he power over those who turn away from god and join otherdeities with him and when we change one sign verse for another and god knoweth best what herevealeth they say thou art only a fabricator nay but most of them haveno knowledge say the holy spirit hath brought it down with truth from thy lord that hemay stablish those who have believed and as guidance and glad tidings to themuslims we also know that they say surely a certain person teacheth him but thetongue of him at whom they hint is foreign while this koran is in theplain arabic as for those who believe not in the signs of god god will not guide them and a sore torment doth await them surely they invent a lie who believe not in the signs of god and they are theliars whoso after he hath believed in god denieth him if he were forced to it andif his heart remain steadfast in the faith shall be guiltless but whosoopeneth his breast to infidelity on such shall be wrath from god and asevere punishment awaiteth them this because they have loved this present life beyond the next and becausegod guideth not the unbelievers these are they whose hearts and ears and eyes god hath sealed up these arethe careless ones in the next world shall they perish beyond a doubt to those also who after their trials fled their country then fought andendured with patience verily thy lord will in the end be forgiving gracious on a certain day shall every soul come to plead for itself and every soulshall be repaid according to its deeds and they shall not be wronged god proposeth the instance of a city secure and at ease to which itssupplies come in plenty from every side but she was thankless for the boonsof god god therefore made her taste the woe of famine and of fear forwhat they had done moreover an apostle of their own people came to them and they treated himas an impostor so chastisement overtook them because they were evil doers of what god hath supplied you eat the lawful and good and be grateful forthe favours of god if ye are his worshippers forbidden to you is that only which dieth of itself and blood and swine sflesh and that which hath been slain in the name of any other than god butif any be forced and neither lust for it nor wilfully transgress thenverily god is forgiving gracious and say not with a lie upon your tongue this is lawful and this isforbidden for so will ye invent a lie concerning god but they who invent alie of god shall not prosper brief their enjoyment but sore their punishment to the jews we have forbidden that of which we before told thee we injuredthem not but they injured themselves to those who have done evil in ignorance then afterwards have repented andamended verily thy lord is in the end right gracious merciful verily abraham was a leader in religion obedient to god sound infaith he was not of those who join gods with god grateful was he for his favours god chose him and guided him into thestraight way and we bestowed on him good things in this world and in the world to come heshall be among the just we have moreover revealed to thee that thou follow the religion of abraham the sound in faith he was not of those who join gods with god the sabbath was only ordained for those who differed about it and of a truththy lord will decide between them on the day of resurrection as to thesubject of their disputes summon thou to the way of thy lord with wisdom and with kindly warning dispute with them in the kindest manner thy lord best knoweth those whostray from his way and he best knoweth those who have yielded to hisguidance if ye make reprisals then make them to the same extent that ye wereinjured but if ye can endure patiently best will it be for the patientlyenduring endure then with patience but thy patient endurance must be sought in nonebut god and be not

promise of god to his promise god will not be untrue but most menknow it not they know the outward shews of this life present but of the next life arethey careless have they not considered within themselves that god hath not created theheavens and the earth and all that is between them but for a serious end andfor a fixed term but truly most men believe not that they shall meet theirlord have they never journeyed through the land and seen what hath been the endof those who were before them mightier were they than these in strength andthey broke up the land and dwelt in it in greater numbers than they whodwell there now and their apostles came to them with proofs of theirmission and it was not god who would wrong them but they wrongedthemselves then evil was the end of the evil doers because they had treated our signsas lies and laughed them to scorn god bringth forth the creation then causeth it to return again then to himshall ye come back and on the day when the hour shall arrive the guilty shall be struck dumbfor despair and they shall have no intercessors from among the gods whom they have joinedwith god and they shall deny the gods they joined with him and on that day when the hour shall arrive shall men be separated one fromanother and as for those who shall have believed and done the things that are right they shall enjoy themselves in a flowery mead but as for those who shall not have believed but treated our signs and themeeting of the next life as lies they shall be given over to the torment glorify god therefore when ye reach the evening and when ye rise at morn and to him be praise in the heavens and on the earth and at twilight andwhen ye rest at noon he bringeth forth the living out of the dead and he bringeth forth the deadout of the living and he quickeneth the earth when dead thus is it that yetoo shall be brought forth and one of his signs it is that he hath created you out of dust then lo yebecome men who spread themselves far and wide and one of his signs it is that he hath created wives for you of your ownspecies that ye may dwell with them and hath put love and tendernessbetween you herein truly are signs for those who reflect and among his signs are the creation of the heavens and of the earth andyour variety of tongues and colour herein truly are signs for all men and of his signs are your sleep by night and by day and your goings in questof his bounties herein truly are signs to those who hearken and of his signs are that he sheweth you the lightning a source of awe andhope and that he sendeth down rain from the heaven and giveth life by it tothe earth when dead herein truly are signs to those who understand and of his signs also one is that the heaven and the earth stand firm at hisbidding hereafter when with one summons he shall summon you out of theearth lo forth shall ye come his whatsoever is in the heavens and on the earth all are obedient to him and he it is who bringeth a creature forth then causeth it to return again and to him is this most easy to whatever is loftiest in heaven and earth ishe to be likened and he is the mighty the wise he setteth forth to you an instance drawn from yourselves have ye among theslaves whom your right hands have won any partner in what we have bestowedon you so that ye share alike fear ye them as ye fear each other thusmake we our signs clear to men of understanding no ye do not but the wicked devoid of knowledge follow their owndesires and those whom god shall mislead who shall guide and who shall betheir protector set thou thy face then as a true convert towards the faith which god hathmade and for which he hath made man no change is there in the creation ofgod this is the right faith but the greater part of men know it not and be ye turned to him and fear him and observe prayer and be not ofthose who unite gods with god of those who have split up their religion and have become sects where everyparty rejoices in what is their own when some evil toucheth men they turn to their lord and call upon him thenwhen he hath made them taste his mercy lo a part of them join other godswith their lord ungrateful for our favours enjoy yourselves then but in the end ye shallknow your folly have we sent down to them any mandate which speaketh in favour of what theyjoin with god when we cause men to taste mercy they rejoice in it but if for that whichtheir hands have aforetime wrought evil befall them they despair see they not that god bestoweth full supplies on whom he pleaseth and givethsparingly to whom he pleaseth signs truly are there herein to those whobelieve to him who is of kin to thee give his due and to the poor and to thewayfarer this will be best for those who seek the face of god and with themit shall be well whatever ye put out at usury to increase it with the substance of othersshall have no increase from god but whatever ye shall give in alms asseeking the face of god shall be doubled to you it is god who created you then fed you then will cause you to die then willmake you alive is there any of your companion gods who can do aught of thesethings praise be to him and far be he exalted above the gods they join withhim destruction hath appeared by land and by sea on account of what men s handshave wrought that it might make them taste somewhat of the fruit of theirdoings that haply they might turn to god say journey through the land and see what hath been the end of those whowere before you the greater part of them joined other gods with god set thy face then towards the right faith ere the day come which none canhinder god from bringing on on that day shall they be parted in twain unbelievers on whom shall be their unbelief and they who have wroughtrighteousness and prepared for themselves couches of repose that of his bounty he may reward those who have believed and wroughtrighteousness for the unbelievers he loveth not and one of his signs is that he sendeth the winds with glad tidings of rain both that he may cause you to taste his mercy and that ships may sail at hiscommand that out of his bounties ye may seek wealth and that haply ye mayrender thanks we have sent apostles before thee to their peoples and they presentedthemselves to them with clear proofs of their mission and while it behovedus to succour the faithful we took vengeance on the guilty it is god who sendeth the winds and uplifteth the clouds and as hepleaseth spreadeth them on high and breaketh them up and thou mayest seethe rain issuing from their midst and when he poureth it down on such of hisservants as he pleaseth lo they are filled with joy even they who before it was sent down to them were in mute despair look then at the traces of god s mercy how after its death he quickeneth theearth this same god will surely quicken the dead for to all things hismight is equal yet should we send a blast and should they see their harvest turn yellow they would afterwards shew themselves ungrateful thou canst not make the dead to hear neither canst thou make the deaf tohear the call when they withdraw and turn their backs neither canst thou guide the blind out of their error in sooth none shaltthou make to hear save him who shall believe in our signs for they areresigned to our will muslims it is god who hath created you in weakness then after weakness hath givenyou strength then after strength weakness and grey hairs he createth whathe will and he is the wise the powerful and on the day whereon the hour shall arrive the wicked will swearthat not above an hour have they waited even so did they utter lies onearth but they to whom knowledge and faith have been given will say ye havewaited in accordance with the book of god till the day of resurrection forthis is the day of the resurrection but ye knew it not on that day their plea shall not avail the wicked neither shall they againbe bidden to seek acceptance with god and now have we set before men in this koran every kind of parable yet ifthou bring them a single verse of it the infidels will surely say ye areonly utterers of vain things it is thus that god hath sealed up the hearts of those who are devoid ofknowledge but do thou muhammad bear with patience for true is the promise of god and let not those who have no firm belief unsettle thee see sura lxviii p by the persians probably in palestine in

inspiration oftheir prophet but it should be borne in mind that the vowel points of theconsonants of the arabic word for defeated in verse not being originallywritten and depending entirely on the

and his favourswill he bestow on every one who deserves his favours but if ye turn away then verily i fear for you the chastisement of the great day unto god shall ye return and over all things is he potent do they not doubly fold up their breasts that they may hide themselves fromhim but when they enshroud themselves in their garments doth he not know alikewhat they conceal and what they shew for he knoweth the very inmost of their breast there is no moving thing on earth whose nourishment dependeth not on god heknoweth its haunts and final resting place all is in the clear book and he it is who hath made the heavens and the earth in six days his thronehad stood ere this upon the waters that he might make proof which of youwould excel in works and if thou say after death ye shall surely be raised again the infidelswill certainly exclaim this is nothing but pure sorcery and if we defer their chastisement to some definite time they will exclaim what keepeth it back what will it not come upon them on a day when thereshall be none to avert it from them and that at which they scoffed shallenclose them in on every side and if we cause man to taste our mercy and then deprive him of

ourselves and we see not who have followed thee except our meanestones of hasty judgment nor see we any excellence in you above ourselves nay we deem you liars he said o my people how think you if i am upon a clear revelation from mylord who hath bestowed on me mercy from himself to which ye are blind canwe force it on you if ye are averse from it and o my people i ask you not for riches my reward is of god alone and iwill not drive away those who believe that they shall meet their lord but isee that ye are an ignorant people and o my people were i to drive them away who shall help me against god will ye not therefore consider and i tell you not that with me are the treasures of god nor do i say iknow the things unseen nor do i say i am an angel nor do i say of thosewhom you eye

it was said avaunt ye tribe of the wicked and noah called on his lord and said o lord verily my son is of my family and thy promise is true and thou art the most just of judges he said o noah verily he is not of thy family in this thou actest notaright ask not of me that whereof thou knowest nought i warn thee thatthou become not of the ignorant he said to thee verily o my lord do i repair lest i

peoples to be born from those who are with thee but as for otherand unbelieving peoples we will give them their good things in this world but hereafter shall a grievous punishment light on them from

brother houd he said o my people worship god you have no god beside him ye only devise a lie o my people i ask of you no recompense for this my recompense is with himonly who hath made me will ye not then understand o my people ask pardon of your lord then be turned unto him he will senddown the heavens upon you with copious rains and with strength on strength will he increase you only turn not back withdeeds of evil they said o houd thou hast not brought us proofs of thy mission we willnot abandon our gods at thy word and we believe thee not we can only say that some of our gods have smitten thee with evil said he now take i god to witness and do ye also witness that i am clear of yourjoining other godsto god conspire then against me all of you and delay me not for i trust in god my lord and yours no single beast is there which heholdeth not by its forelock right truly is the way in which my lord goeth but if ye turn back i have already declared to you my message and my lordwill put another people in your place nor shall ye at all hurt him verily my lord keepeth watch over all things and when our doom came to be inflicted we rescued houd and those who hadlike faith with him by our special mercy we rescued them from the rigorouschastisement these men of ad gainsaid the signs of their lord and rebelled against hismessengers and followed the bidding of every proud contumacious person followed therefore were they in this world by a curse and in the day of theresurrection it shall be said to them what did not ad disbelieve theirlord was not ad the people of houd cast far away and unto themoud we sent their brother saleh o my people said he worship god you have no other god than him he hath raised you up out of theearth and hath given you to dwell therein ask pardon of him then and beturned unto him for thy lord is nigh ready to answer they said o saleh our hopes were fixed on thee till now forbiddest thouus to worship what our fathers worshipped truly we misdoubt the faith towhich thou callest us as suspicious he said o my people what think ye if i have a revelation from my lord tosupport me and if he hath shewed his mercy on me who could protect me fromgod if i rebel against him ye would only confer on me increase of ruin o my people this is the she camel of god and a sign unto you let her go atlarge and feed in god s earth and do her no harm lest a speedy punishmentovertake you yet they hamstrung her then said he yet three days more enjoy yourselvesin your dwellings this menace will not prove untrue and when our sentence came to pass we rescued saleh and those who had a likefaith with him by our mercy from ignominy on that day verily thy lord isthe strong the mighty and a violent tempest overtook the wicked and they were found in the morningprostrate in their dwellings as though they had never abode in them what did not themoud disbelieve hislord was not themoud utterly cast off and our messengers came formerly to abraham with glad tidings peace saidthey he said peace and he tarried not but brought a roasted calf and when he saw that their hands touched it not he misliked them and grewfearful of them they said fear not for we are sent to the people of lot his wife was standing by and laughed and we announced isaac to her andafter isacc jacob she said ah woe is me shall i bear a son when i am old and when this myhusband is an old man this truly would be a marvellous thing they said marvellest thou at the command of god god s mercy and blessingbe upon you o people of this house praise and glory are his due and when abraham s fear had passed away and these glad tidings had reachedhim he pleaded with us for the people of lot verily abraham was rightkind pitiful relenting o abraham desist from this for already hath the command of thy god goneforth as for them a punishment not to be averted is coming on them and when our messengers came to lot he was grieved for them and he was tooweak to protect them and he said this is a day of difficulty and his people came rushing on towards him for aforetime had they wroughtthis wickedness he said o my people these my daughters will be purer foryou fear god and put me not to shame in my guests is there no rightmindedman among you they said thou knowest now that we need not thy daughters and thou wellknowest what we require he said would that i had strength to resist you or that i could findrefuge with some powerful chieftain the angels said o lot verily we are the messengers of thy lord theyshall not touch thee depart with thy family in the dead of night and letnot one of you turn back as for thy wife on her shall light what shalllight on them verily that with which they are threatened is for themorning is not the morning near and when our decree came to be executed we turned those cities upside down and we rained down upon them blocks of claystone one after another markedby thy lord himself nor are they far distant from the wicked meccans and we sent to madian their brother shoaib he said o my people worshipgod no other god have you than he give not short weight and measure i seeindeed that ye revel in good things but i fear for you the punishment of theall encompassing day o my people give weight and measure with fairness purloin not other men sgoods and perpetrate not injustice on the earth with corrupt practices a residue the gift of god will be best for you if ye are believers but i am not a guardian over you they said to him o shoaib is it thy prayers which enjoin that we shouldleave what our fathers worshipped or that we should not do with oursubstance as pleaseth us thou forsooth art the mild the right director he said o my people how think ye if i have a clear revelation from mylord and if from himself he hath supplied me with goodly supplies and if iwill not follow you in that which i myself forbid you do i seek aught butyour amendment so far as in me lieth my sole help is in god in him do itrust and to him do i turn me o my people let not your opposition to me draw down upon you the like ofthat which befel the people of noah or the people of houd or the people ofsaleh and the abodes of the people of lot are not far distant from you seek pardon of your lord and be turned unto him verily my lord is merciful loving they said o shoaib we understand not much of what thou sayest and weclearly see that thou art powerless among us were it not for thy family wewould have surely stoned thee nor couldest thou have prevailed against us he said o my people think ye more highly of my family than of god cast yehim behind your back with neglect verily my lord is round about youractions and o my people act with what power ye can for my hurt i verily will act and ye shall knowon whom shall light a punishment that shall disgrace him and who is theliar await ye verily i will await with you and when our decree came to pass we delivered shoaib and his companions infaith by our mercy and a violent tempest overtook the wicked and in themorning they were found prostrate in their housesas if they had never dwelt in them was not madian swept off even as themoudhad been swept off of old sent we moses with our signs and with incontestable power to pharaoh and to his nobles who followed the behests of pharaoh and unrighteous werepharaoh s behests he shall head his people on the day of the resurrection and cause them todescend into the fire and wretched the descent by which they shall descend they were followed by a curse in this world and in the day of theresurrection wretched the gift that shall be given them such the histories of the cities which we relate to thee some of them arestanding others mown down we dealt not unfairly by them but they dealt not fairly by themselves andtheir gods on whom they called beside god availed them not at all when thylord s behest came to pass they did but increase their ruin such was thy lord s grasp when he laid that grasp on the cities that hadbeen wicked verily his grasp is afflictive terrible herein truly is a sign for him who feareth the punishment of the latter day that shall be a day unto which mankind shall be gathered together that shallbe a day witnessed by all creatures nor do we delay it but until a time appointed when that day shall come no one shall speak a word but by his leave and someshall be miserable and others blessed and as for those who shall be consigned to misery their place the fire therein shall they sigh and bemoan them therein shall they abide while the heavens and the earth shall last unlessthy lord shall will it otherwise verily thy lord doth what he chooseth and as for the blessed ones their place the garden therein shall they abidewhile the heavens and the earth endure with whatever imperishable boon thylord may please to add have thou no doubts therefore concerning that which they worship theyworship but what their fathers worshipped before them we will surely assignthem their portion with nothing lacking of old gave we moses the book and they fell to variance about it if adecree of respite had not gone forth from thy lord there had surely been adecision between them thy people also are in suspicious doubts about thekoran and truly thy lord will repay every one according to their works for he iswell aware of what they do go straight on then as thou hast been commanded and he also who hath turnedto god with thee and let him transgress no more he beholdeth what ye do lean not on the evil doers lest the fire lay hold on you ye have noprotector save god and ye shall not be helped against him and observe prayer at early morning at the close of the day and at theapproach of night for the good deeds drive away the evil deeds this is awarning for those who reflect and persevere steadfastly for verily god will not suffer the reward of therighteous to perish were the generations before you endued with virtue and who forbad corruptdoings on the earth more than a few of those whom we delivered but the evildoers followed their selfish pleasures and became transgressors and thy lord was not one who would destroy those cities unjustly when itsinhabitants were righteous had thy lord pleased he would have made mankind of one religion but thoseonly to whom thy lord hath granted his mercy will cease to differ and untothis hath he created them for the word of thy lord shall be fulfilled iwill wholly fill hell with djinn and men and all that we have related to thee of the histories of these apostles isto confirm thy heart thereby by these hath the truth reached thee and

fromthe way of god and seek to make it crooked these are in a far gone error and in order that he might speak plainly to them we have not sent anyapostle save with the speech of his own people but god misleadeth whom hewill and whom he will he guideth and he is the mighty the wise of old did we send moses with our signs and said to him bring forth thypeople from the darkness into the light and remind them of the days of god verily in this are signs for every patient grateful person when moses said to his people remember the kindness of god to you when herescued you from the family of pharaoh who laid on you a cruel affliction slaughtering your male children and suffering only your females to live inthis was a sore trial from your lord and when your lord caused it to be heard that if we render thanks then willi surely increase you more and more but if ye be thankless verily right terrible my chastisement and moses said if ye and all who are on the earth be thankless yet trulygod is passing rich and worthy of all praise hath not the story reached you of those who were before you the people ofnoah and ad and themoud and of those who lived after them none knoweth them but god when theirprophets came to them with proofs of their mission they put their hands ontheir mouths and said in sooth we believe not your message and in sooth of that to which you bid us we are in doubt as of a thing suspicious their prophets said is there any doubt concerning god maker of the heavensand of the earth who calleth you that he may pardon your sins and respiteyou until an appointed time they said ye are but men like us fain would ye turn us from our fathers worship bring us therefore some clear proof their apostles said to them we are indeed but men like you but godbestoweth favours on such of his servants as he pleaseth and it is not inour power to bring you any special proof but by the leave of god in god therefore let the faithful trust and why should we not put our trust in god since he hath already guided usin our ways we will certainly bear with constancy the harm you would do tous in god let the trustful trust and they who believed not said to their apostles forth from our land willwe surely drive you or to our religion shall ye return then their lordrevealed to them we will certainly destroy the wicked doers and we shall certainly cause you to dwell in the land after them this forhim who dreadeth the appearance at my judgment seat and who dreadeth mymenace then sought they help from god and every proud rebellious one perished hell is before him and of tainted water shall he be made to drink he shall sup it and scarce swallow it for loathing and death shall assailhim on every side but he shall not die and before him shall be seen agrievous torment a likeness of those who believe not in their lord their works are like asheswhich the wind scattereth on a stormy day no advantage shall they gain fromtheir works this is the far gone wandering seest thou not that in truth hath god created the heavens and the earth were such his pleasure he could make you pass away and cause a new creationto arise and this would not be hard for god all mankind shall come forth before god and the weak shall say to the men ofmight verily we were your followers will ye not then relieve us of somepart of the vengeance of god they shall say if god had guided us we surely had guided you it is nowall one whether we be impatient or endure with patience we have no escape and after doom hath been given satan shall say verily god promised you apromise of truth i too made you a promise but i deceived you yet i hadno power over you but i only called you and ye answered me blame not me then but blameyourselves i cannot aid you neither can ye aid me i never believed that iwas his equal with whom ye joined me as for the evil doers a grievoustorment doth await them but they who shall have believed and done the things that be right shall bebrought into gardens beneath which the rivers flow therein shall they abidefor ever by the permission of their lord their greeting therein shall be peace seest thou not to what god likeneth a good word to a good tree its rootfirmly fixed and its branches in the heaven yielding its fruit in all seasons by the will of its lord god setteth forththese similitudes to men that haply they may reflect and an evil word is like an evil tree torn up from the face of the earth andwithout strength to stand those who believe shall god stablish by his steadfast word both in this lifeand in that which is to come but the wicked shall he cause to err god dothhis pleasure hast thou not beholden those who repay the goodness of god with infidelity and sink their people into the abode of perdition hell therein shall they be burned and wretched the dwelling they set up compeers with god in order to mislead man from his way say enjoy your pleasures yet awhile but assuredly your going hence shall beinto the fire speak to my servants who have believed that they observe prayer and givealms of that with which we have supplied them both privately and openly erethe day come when there shall be neither traffic nor friendship it is god who hath created the heavens and the earth and sendeth down waterfrom the heaven and so bringeth forth the fruits for your food and he hathsubjected to you the ships so that by his command they pass through thesea and he hath subjected the rivers to you and he hath subjected to youthe sun and the moon in their constant courses and he hath subjected the dayand the night to you of everything which ye ask him giveth he to you andif ye would reckon up the favours of god ye cannot count them surely man isunjust ungrateful abraham said o lord make this land secure and turn aside me and mychildren from serving idols for many men o my lord have they led astray but whosoever shall follow me he truly shall be of me and whosoever shall disobey me thou trulyart gracious merciful o our lord verily i have settled some of my offspring in an unfruitfulvalley nigh to thy holy house o our lord that they may strictly observeprayer make thou therefore the hearts of men to yearn toward them andsupply them with fruits that they may be thankful o our lord thou truly knowest what we hide and what we bring to light nought on earth or in heaven is hidden from god praise be to god who hathgiven me in my old age ismael and isaac my lord is the hearer of prayer lord grant that i and my posterity may observe prayer o our lord and grantthis my petition o our lord forgive me and my parents and the faithful onthe day wherein account shall be taken think thou not that god is regardless of the deeds of the wicked he onlyrespiteth them to the day on which all eyes shall stare up with terror they hasten forward in fear their heads upraised in supplication theirlooks riveted and their hearts a blank warn men therefore of the day whenthe punishment shall overtake them and when the evil doers shall say o our lord respite us yet a littlewhile to thy call will we make answer thine apostles will we follow did ye notonce swear that no change should befal you yet ye dwelt in the dwellings of those who were the authors of theirundoing and it was made plain to you how we had dealt with them and we heldthem up to you as examples they plotted their plots but god could mastertheir plots even though their plots had been so powerful as to move themountains think not then that god will fail his promise to his apostles aye god ismighty and vengeance is his on the day when the earth shall be changed into another earth and theheavens also men shall come forth unto god the only the victorious and thou shalt see the wicked on that day linked together in chains their garments of pitch and fire shall enwrap their faces that god mayreward every soul as it deserveth verily god is prompt to reckon this is a message for mankind that they may thereby be warned and that theymay know that there is but one god and that men of understanding may ponderit see sura lxxxiv x lit i truly renounce your having associated me with god heretofore the preaching and the profession of islam comp ps i the caaba lit to a term near at hand of the anciently destroyed cities of themoud ad etc lit were unjust to their own souls sura xii joseph peace be on him lxxvii mecca iii versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulelif lam ra these are signs of the clear book an arabic koran have we sent it down that ye might understand it in revealing to thee this koran one of the most beautiful of narrativeswill we narrate to thee of which thou hast hitherto been regardless when joseph said to his father o my father verily i beheld eleven starsand the sun and the moon beheld them make obeisance to me he said o my son tell not thy vision to thy brethren lest they plot aplot against thee for satan is the manifest foe of man it is thus that thy lord shall choose thee and will teach thee theinterpretation of dark saying and will perfect his favours on thee and onthe family of jacob as of old he perfected it on thy fathers abraham andisaac verily thy lord is knowing wise now in joseph and his brethren are signs for the enquirers when they said surely better loved by our father than we who are more innumber is joseph and his brother verily our father hath clearly erred slay ye joseph or drive him to some other land and on you alone shall yourfather s face be set and after this ye shall live as upright persons one of them said slay not joseph but cast him down to the bottom of thewell if ye do so some wayfarers will take him up they said o our father why dost thou not entrust us with joseph indeed wemean him well send him with us to morrow that he may enjoy himself and sport we willsurely keep him safely he said verily your taking him away will grieve me and i fear lest whileye are heedless of him the wolf devour him they said surely if the wolf devour him and we so many we must in thatcase be weak indeed and when they went away with him they agreed to place him at the bottom ofthe well and we revealed to him thou wilt yet tell them of this theirdeed when they shall not know thee and they came at nightfall to their father weeping they said o our father of a truth we went to run races and we leftjoseph with our clothes and the wolf devoured him but thou wilt not believeus even though we speak the truth and they brought his shirt with false blood upon it he said nay butyourselves have managed this affair but patience is seemly and the help ofgod is to be implored that i may bear what you tell me and wayfarers came and sent their drawer of water and he let down hisbucket good news said he this is a youth and they kept his casesecret to make merchandise of him but god knew what they did and they sold him for a paltry price for some dirhems counted down and at nohigh rate did they value him and he who bought him an egyptian said to his wife treat him hospitably haply he may be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son thus did wesettle joseph in the land and we instructed him in the interpretation ofdark sayings for god is equal to his purpose but most men know it not and when he had reached his age of strength we bestowed on him judgment andknowledge for thus do we recompense the well doers and she in whose house he was conceived a passion for him and she shut thedoors and said come hither he said god keep me verily my lord hathgiven me a good home and the injurious shall not prosper but she longed for him and he had longed for her had he not seen a tokenfrom his lord thus we averted evil and defilement from him for he was oneof our sincere servants and they both made for the door and she rent his shirt behind and at thedoor they met her lord what said she shall be the recompense of him whowould do evil to thy family but a prison or a sore punishment he said she solicited me to evil and a witness out of her own familywitnessed if his shirt be rent in front she speaketh truth and he is aliar but if his shirt be rent behind she lieth and he is true and when his lord saw his shirt torn behind he said this is one of yourdevices verily your devices are great joseph leave this affair and thou o wife ask pardon for thy crime forthou hast sinned and in the city the women said the wife of the prince hath solicited herservant he hath fired her with his love but we clearly see her manifesterror and when she heard of their cabal she sent to them and got ready a banquetfor them and gave each one of them a knife and said joseph shew thyselfto them and when they saw him they were amazed at him and cut theirhands and said god keep us this is no man this is no other than anoble angel she said this is he about whom ye blamed me i wished him to yield to mydesires but he stood firm but if he obey not my command he shall surely becast into prison and become one of the despised he said o my lord i prefer the prison to compliance with their bidding but unless thou turn away their snares from me i shall play the youth withthem and become one of the unwise and his lord heard him and turned aside their snares from him for he is thehearer the knower yet resolved they even after they had seen the signs of his innocence toimprison him for a time and there came into the prison with him two youths said one of them methought in my dream that i was pressing grapes and the other said idreamed that i was carrying bread on my head of which the birds did eat declare to us the interpretation of this for we see thou art a virtuousperson he said there shall not come to you in a dream any food wherewith ye shallbe fed but i will acquaint you with its interpretation ere it come to passto you this is a part of that which my lord hath taught me for i haveabandoned the religion of those who believe not in god and who deny thelife to come and i follow the religion of my fathers abraham and isaac and jacob we maynot associate aught with god this is of god s bounty towards us and towardsmankind but the greater part of mankind are not thankful o my two fellow prisoners are sundry lords best or god the one themighty ye worship beside him mere names which ye have named ye and your fathers for which god hath not sent down any warranty judgment belongeth to godalone he hath bidden you worship none but him this is the right faith butmost men know it not o my two fellow prisoners as to one of you he will serve wine unto hislord but as to the other he will be crucified and the birds shall eat fromoff his head the matter is decreed concerning which ye enquire and he said unto him who he judged would be set at large remember me withthy lord but satan caused him to forget the remembrance of his lord sohe remained some years in prison and the king said verily i saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven leandevoured and seven green ears and other withered o nobles teach me myvision if a vision ye are able to expound they said they are confused dreams nor know we aught of the unravelling ofdreams and he of the twain who had been set at large said i will tell you theinterpretation let me go for it joseph man of truth teach us of the seven fat kine which seven leandevoured and of the seven green ears and other withered that i may returnto the men and that they may be informed he said ye shall sow seven years as is your wont and the corn which yereap leave ye in its ear except a little of which ye shall eat then after that shall come seven grievous years which shall eat what ye havestored for them except a little which ye shall have kept then shall come after this a year in which men shall have rain and in whichthey shall press the grape and the king said bring him to me and when the messenger came to josephhe said go back to thy lord and ask him what meant the women who cut theirhands for my lord well knoweth the snare they laid then said the prince to the women what was your purpose when ye solicitedjoseph they said god keep us we know not any ill of him the wife ofthe prince said now doth the truth appear it was i who would have led himinto unlawful love and he is one of the truthful by this said joseph may my lord know that i did not in his absence playhim false and that god guideth not the machinations of deceivers yet i hold not myself clear for the heart is prone to evil save theirs onwhom my lord hath mercy for gracious is my lord merciful and the king said bring him to me i will take him for my special service and when he had spoken with him he said from this day shalt thou be withus invested with place and trust he said set me over the granaries of the land i will be their prudentkeeper thus did we stablish joseph in the land that he might house himself thereinat pleasure we bestow our favours on whom we will and suffer not the rewardof the righteous to perish and truly the recompense of the life to come is better for those who havebelieved and feared god and joseph s brethren came and went in to him and he knew them but theyrecognised him not and when he had provided them with their provision he said bring me yourbrother from your father see ye not that i fill the measure and am the bestof hosts but if ye bring him not to me then no measure of corn shall there be for youfrom me nor shall ye come near me they said we will ask him of his father and we will surely do it said he to his servants put their money into their camel packs that theymay perceive it when they have returned to their family haply they will comeback to us and when they returned to their father they said o our father corn iswithholden from us send therefore our brother with us and we shall haveour measure and all care of him will we take he said shall i entrust you with him otherwise than as i before entrustedyou with his brother but god is the best guardian and of those who shewcompassion he is the most compassionate and when they opened their goods they found their money had been returned tothem they said o our father what more can we desire here is our moneyreturned to us we will provide corn for our families and will take care ofour brother and shall receive a camel s burden more of corn this is an easyquantity he said i will not send him with you but on your oath before god that yewill indeed bring him back to me unless hindrances encompass you andwhen they had given him their pledge he said god is witness of what wesay and he said o my sons enter not by one gate but enter by differentgates yet can i not help you against aught decreed by god judgmentbelongeth to god alone in him put i my trust and in him let the trustingtrust and when they entered as their father had bidden them it did not avert fromthem anything decreed of god but it only served to satisfy a desire in thesoul of jacob which he had charged them to perform for he was possessed ofknowledge which we had taught him but most men have not that knowledge and when they came in to joseph he took his brother to him he said verily i am thy brother be not thou grieved for what they did and when he had provided them with their provisions he placed his drinkingcup in his brother s camel pack then a crier cried after them otravellers ye are surely thieves they turned back to them and said what is that ye miss we miss said they the prince s cup for him who shall restore it acamel s load of corn i pledge myself for it they said by god ye know certainly that we came not to do wrong in theland and we have not been thieves what said the egyptians shall be the recompense of him who hath stolenit if ye be found liars they said that he in whose camel pack it shall be found be given up to youin satisfaction for it thus recompense we the unjust and joseph began with their sacks before the sack of his brother and thenfrom the sack of his brother he drew it out this stratagem did we suggest tojoseph by the king s law he had no power to seize his brother had not godpleased we uplift into grades of wisdom whom we will and there is oneknowing above every one else endued with knowledge they said if he steal a brother of his hath stolen heretofore butjoseph kept his secret and did not discover it to them said he aside yeare in the worse condition and god well knoweth what ye state they said o prince verily he hath a very aged father in his stead therefore take one of us for we see that thou art a generous person he said god forbid that we should take but him with whom our property wasfound for then should we act unjustly and when they despaired of benjamin they went apart for counsel the eldestof them said know ye not how that your father hath taken a pledge from youbefore god and how formerly ye failed in duty with regard to joseph i willnot quit the land till my father give me leave or god decide for me for ofthose who decide is he the best return ye to your father and say o our father verily thy son hath stolen we bear witness only of what we know we could not guard against theunforeseen enquire for thyself in the city where we have been and of the caravan withwhich we have arrived and we are surely speakers of the truth he said nay ye have arranged all this among yourselves but patience isseemly god may be will bring them back to me together for he is theknowing the wise and he turned away from them and said oh how i am grieved for joseph andhis eyes became white with grief for he bore a silent sorrow they said by god thou wilt only cease to think of joseph when thou art atthe point of death or dead he said i only plead my grief and my sorrow to god but i know from godwhat ye know not go my sons and seek tidings of joseph and his brother and despair not ofgod s mercy for none but the unbelieving despair of the mercy of god and when they came in to joseph they said o prince distress hath reachedus and our family and little is the money that we have brought but give usfull measure and bestow it as alms for god will recompense the almsgivers he said know ye what ye did to joseph and his brother in your ignorance they said canst thou indeed be joseph he said i am joseph and this ismy brother now hath god been gracious to us for whoso feareth god andendureth god verily will not suffer the reward of the righteous toperish they said by god now hath god chosen thee above us and we have indeedbeen sinners he said no blame be on you this day god will forgive you for he is themost merciful of those who shew mercy go ye with this my shirt and throw it on my father s face and he shallrecover his sight and bring me all your family and when the caravan was departed their father said i surely perceive thesmell of joseph think ye that i dote they said by god it is thy old mistake and when the bearer of good tidings came he cast it on his face and jacob seyesight returned then he said did i not tell you that i knew from god what ye knew not they said our father ask pardon for our crimes for us for we have indeedbeen sinners he said i will ask your pardon of my lord for he is gracious merciful and when they came into joseph he took his parents to him and said enterye egypt if god will secure and he raised his parents to the seat of state and they fell down bowingthemselves unto him then said he o my father this is the meaning of mydream of old my lord hath now made it true and he hath surely been graciousto me since he took me forth from the prison and hath brought you up out ofthe desert after that satan had stirred up strife between me and mybrethren for my lord is gracious to whom he will for he is the knowing thewise o my lord thou hast given me dominion and hast taught me to expound darksayings maker of the heavens and of the earth my guardian art thou in thisworld and in the next cause thou me to die a muslim and join me with thejust this is one of the secret histories which we reveal unto thee thou wastnot present with joseph s brethren when they conceived their design and laidtheir plot but the greater part of men though thou long for it will notbelieve thou shalt not ask of them any recompense for this message it is simply aninstruction for all mankind and many as are the signs in the heavens and on the earth yet they will passthem by and turn aside from them and most of them believe not in god without also joining other deities withhim what are they sure that the overwhelming chastisement of god shall not comeupon them or that that hour shall not come upon them suddenly while theyare unaware say this is my way resting on a clear proof i call you to god i and whosofolloweth me and glory be to god i am not one of those who add otherdeities to him never before thee have we sent any but men chosen out of the people of thecities to whom we made revelations will they not journey through the land and see what hath been the end of those who were before them but themansions of the next life shall be better for those who fear god will theynot then comprehend when at last the apostles lost all hope and deemed that they were reckonedas liars our aid reached them and we delivered whom we would but ourvengeance was not averted from the wicked certainly in their histories is an example for men of understanding this isno new tale of fiction but a confirmation of previous scriptures and anexplanation of all things and guidance and mercy to those who believe see sura lxviii p in no other sura beside this is one subject treatedof throughout it was recited to the first eight of the

deceive thee the people of noah and the confederates after them have brought the chargeof imposture before these meccans each nation schemed against their apostleto lay violent hold on him and disputed with vain words to refute the truth therefore did i lay violent hold on them and how great was my chastisement thus is it that thy lord s sentence that inmates shall they be of the fire was accomplished upon the infidels they who bear the throne and they who encircle it celebrate the praise oftheir lord and believe in him and implore forgiveness for the believers oour lord thou embracest all things in mercy and knowledge forgive therefore those who turn to thee and follow thy path keep them from thepains of hell o our lord and bring them into the gardens of eden which thou hast promisedto them and to the righteous ones of their fathers and their wives and theirchildren for thou art the all mighty the all wise and keep them from evil for on him hast thou mercy whom on that

when nought thatconcerneth them shall be hidden from god with whom shall be the powersupreme on that day with god the one the almighty on that day shall every soul be recompensed as it hath deserved no injusticeon that day verily god will be swift to reckon warn them then of the approaching day when men s hearts shall rise up choking them into their throats the evil doers shall have no friend or intercessor who shall prevail god knoweth the deceitful of eye and what men s breasts conceal and everything will god decide with truth but nothing shall those gods whommen call on beside him decide verily god the hearer the beholder he have they never journeyed in this land and seen what hath been the end ofthose who flourished before them mightier were they in strength than thesemeccans and their traces remain in the land yet god took them in theirsins and there was none to defend them against god this because their apostles had come to them with proofs of their mission and they believed not so god took them in hand for he is mighty vehementin punishing moreover we had sent moses of old with our signs and with clear authority to pharaoh and haman and karun and they said sorcerer impostor and when he came to them from our presence with the truth they said slaythe sons of those who believe as he doth and save their females alive butthe stratagem of the unbelievers issued only in failure and pharaoh said let me alone that i may kill moses and let him call uponhis lord i fear lest he change your religion or cause disorder to shewitself in the land and moses said i take refuge with my lord and your lord from every proudone who believeth not in the day of reckoning and a man of the family of pharaoh who was a believer but hid his faith said will ye slay a man because he saith my lord is god when he hathalready come to you with proofs of his mission from your lord and if he be aliar on him will be his lie but if he be a man of truth part at least ofwhat he threateneth will fall upon you truly god guideth not him who is atransgressor a liar o my people this day is the kingdom yours the eminent of the earth but whoshall defend us from the vengeance of god if it come on us pharaoh said iwould have you see only what i see and in a right way only will i guideyou then said he who believed o my people truly i fear for you the like of theday of the allies the like of the state of the people of noah and ad and themoud and of those who came after them yet god willeth not injustice to hisservants and o my people i indeed fear for you the day of mutual outcry the day when ye shall be turned back from the judgment into hell noprotector shall ye have then against god and he whom god shall mislead noguide shall there be for him moreover joseph had come to you before with clear tokens but ye ceased notto doubt of the message with which he came to you until when he died yesaid god will by no means raise up an apostle after him thus godmisleadeth him who is the transgressor the doubter they who gainsay the signs of god without authority having come to them aregreatly hated by god and by those who believe thus god sealeth up everyproud contumacious heart and pharaoh said o haman build for me a tower that i may reach theavenues the avenues of the heavens and may mount to the god of moses for i verilydeem him a liar and thus the evil of his doings was made fair seeming to pharaoh and heturned away from the path of truth but the artifice of pharaoh ended only inhis ruin and he who believed said o my people follow me into the right way will iguide you o my people this present life is only a passing joy but the life to come isthe mansion that abideth whoso shall have wrought evil shall not be recompensed but with its like butwhoso shall have done the things that are right whether male or female andis a believer these shall enter paradise good things unreckoned shall theyenjoy therein and o my people how is it that i bid you to salvation but that ye bid meto the fire ye invite me to deny god and to join with him gods of whom i know nothing but i invite you to the mighty the forgiving no doubt is there that they to whom ye invite me are not to be invoked eitherin this world or in the world to come and that unto god is our return andthat the transgressors shall be the inmates of the fire then shall ye remember what i am saying unto you and to god commit i mycase verily god beholdeth his servants so god preserved him from the evils which they had planned and the woe ofthe punishment encompassed the people of pharaoh it is the fire to which they shall be exposed morning and evening and on theday when the hour shall arrive bring in the people of pharaoh into theseverest punishment and when they shall wrangle together in the fire the weak shall say to thosewho had borne themselves so proudly it is you we followed will yetherefore relieve us from aught of the fire and those proud ones shall say verily we are all in it for now hath godjudged between his servants and they who are in the fire shall say to the keepers of hell implore yourlord that he would give us ease but for one day from this torment they shall say came not your apostles to you with the tokens they shallsay yes they shall say cry ye then aloud for help but the cry of theunbelievers shall be only in vain assuredly in this present life will we succour our apostles and those whoshall have believed and on the day when the witnesses shall stand forth a day whereon the plea of the evil doers shall not avail them but theirsshall be a curse and theirs the woe of the abode in hell and of old gave we moses the guidance and we made the children of israel theheritors of the book a guidance and warning to men endued withunderstanding therefore be steadfast thou and patient for true is the promise of god andseek pardon for thy fault and celebrate the praise of thy lord at eveningand at morning as to those who cavil at the signs of god without authority having reachedthem nought is there but pride in their breasts but they shall not succeed fly thou for refuge then to god for he is the hearer the beholder greater surely than the creation of man is the creation of the heavens and ofthe earth but most men know it not moreover the blind and the seeing and the evil doer and they who believeand do the things that are right shall not be deemed equal how few ponderthis aye the hour will surely come there is no doubt of it but most menbelieve it not and your lord saith call upon me i will hearken unto you but they who turnin disdain from my service shall enter hell with shame it is god who hath ordained the night for your rest and the day to give youlight verily god is rich in bounties to men but most men render not thetribute of thanks this is god your lord creator of all things no god is there but he whythen do ye turn away from him yet thus are they turned aside who gainsay the signs of god it is god who hath given you the earth as a sure foundation and over itbuilt up the heaven and formed you and made your forms beautiful andfeedeth you with good things this is god your lord blessed then be god thelord of the worlds he is the living one no god is there but he call then upon him and offerhim a pure worship praise be to god the lord of the worlds say verily i am forbidden to worship what ye call on beside god after thatthe clear tokens have come to me from my lord and i am bidden to surrendermyself to the lord of the worlds he it is who created you of the dust then of the germs of life then ofthick blood then brought you forth infants then he letteth you reach yourfull strength and then become old men but some of you die first and reachthe ordained term and this that haply ye may understand it is he who giveth life and death and when he decreeth a thing he onlysaith of it be and it is seest thou not those who cavil at the signs of god how are they turnedaside they who treat the book and the message with which we have sent our sentones as a lie shall know the truth hereafter when the collars shall be on their necks and the chains to drag them intohell then in the fire shall they be burned then shall it be said to them where are they whom ye made the objects ofjoint worship with god they shall say they have vanished away from us yea it was nought on which we called heretofore thus god leadeth theunbelievers astray this for you because of your unrighteous insolence and immoderate joys onearth enter ye the portals of hell to abide therein for ever and wretched theabode of the haughty ones therefore be thou steadfast in patience for the promise of god is truth andwhether we shall make thee see part of the woes with which we threatenedthem or whether we cause thee first to die unto us shall they be broughtback and we have already sent apostles before thee of some we have told thee andof others we have told thee nothing but no apostle had the power to work amiracle unless by the leave of god but when god s behest cometh everythingwill be decided with truth and then they perish who treated it as a vainthing it is god who hath given you the cattle that on some of them ye may ride andof some may eat other advantages too do ye derive from them and that by them ye may effectthe projects ye cherish in your breasts for on them and on ships are yeborne and he sheweth you his signs which then of the signs of god will ye deny have they not journeyed in this land and seen what hath been the end ofthose who flourished before them more were they than these in number andmightier in strength and greater are the traces of their power remaining inthe land yet their labours availed them nothing and when their apostles had come to them with the tokens of their mission they exulted in what they possessed of knowledge but that retribution atwhich they scoffed encompassed them and when they beheld our vengeance they said we believe in god alone andwe disbelieve in the deities we once associated with him but their faith after they had witnessed our vengeance profited them not such the procedure of god with regard to his servants who flourished of old and then the unbelievers perished see sura xviii p the cherubic beings of scripture are said to be above the throne of god is vi beneath it ezek x and the mystical beasts in therevelations are said to be in the midst of the throne and round about it probably the union of life and death in the womb and the subsequent lifefollowed by death see sura lxxix xxviii thus sura lxxix xxviii and sura lx xxxvi we have a similarcharacter introduced into the narrative comp acts v these tribes no doubt constantly formed temporary alliances muhammadimplies that they were confederate against their prophets haman the favourite of ahasuerus and the enemy of the jews is thus madethe vizier of pharaoh the rabbins make this vizier to have been korah jethro or balaam midr jalkut on ex ch sect and tr solah fol see sura lxxix xxviii thy remissness in propagating islam beidh it is possible that muhammad conscious of his ignorance of jewishhistory intends in this verse to screen himself from the charge of passingover the histories of many of their prophets the wealth of mecca although it still numbered about inhabitants as well as of arabia generally had much declined at the time of muhammad owing mainly to the navigation of the red sea under the roman dominion overegypt which of course impoverished the tribes situated on the line of theold mercantile route southward mecca however was still to a certain extentprosperous comp sura lxi xliii sura xxviii the story lxxix mecca versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulta sin mim these are the signs of the lucid book we will recite to thee portions of the history of moses and pharaoh withtruth for the teaching of the faithful now pharaoh lifted himself up in the earth and divided his people intoparties one portion of them he brought low he slew their male children andlet their females only live for he was one of those who wrought disorders and we were minded to shew favour to those who were brought low in the land and to make them spiritual chiefs and to make them pharaoh s heirs and to stablish them in the land and to make pharaoh and haman and theirhosts the eye witnesses of what they dreaded from them and we said by revelation to the mother of moses give him suck and if thoufearest for him launch him on the sea and fear not neither fret for wewill restore him to thee and make him one of the apostles and pharaoh s family took him up to be a foe and a sorrow to them forsinners were pharaoh and haman and their hosts and pharaoh s wife said joy of the eye to me and thee put him not todeath haply he will be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son but theyknew not what they did and the heart of moses mother became a blank through fear and almost hadshe discovered him but that we girt up her heart with constancy in orderthat she might be one of those who believe she said to his sister follow him and she watched him from afar and theyperceived it not and we caused him to refuse the nurses until his sister came and said shall i point out to you the family of a house that will rear him for you and will be careful of him so we restored him to his mother to be the joy of her eyes and that shemight not fret and that she might know that the promise of god was true butmost men knew it not and when he had reached his age of strength and had become a man webestowed on him wisdom and knowledge for thus do we reward the righteous and he entered a city at the time when its inhabitants would not observehim and found therein two men fighting the one of his own people theother of his enemies and he who was of his own people asked his helpagainst him who was of his enemies and moses smote him with his fist andslew him said he this is a work of satan for he is an enemy a manifestmisleader he said o my lord i have sinned to mine own hurt forgive me so godforgave him for he is the forgiving the merciful he said lord because thou hast showed me this grace i will never again bethe helper of the wicked and in the city at noon he was full of fear casting furtive glances roundhim and lo the man whom he had helped the day before cried out to himagain for help said moses to him thou art plainly a most depraved person and when he would have laid violent hands on him who was their common foe hesaid to him o moses dost thou desire to slay me as thou slayedst a manyesterday thou desirest only to become a tyrant in this land and desirestnot to become a peacemaker but a man came running up from the city s end he said o moses of a truth the nobles consult to slay thee begone then i counsel thee as a friend so forth he went from it in fear looking warily about him he said o lord deliver me from the unjust people and when he was journeying toward madian he said haply my lord will directme in an even path and when he arrived at the water of madian he found at it a company of menwatering and he found beside them two women keeping back their flock why do ye said he thus they said we shall not water till the shepherds shall havedriven off for our father is very aged so he watered for them then retired to the shade and said o my lord of thegood thou hast caused me to meet with i stand in need and one of them came to him walking bashfully said she my father calleththee that he may pay thee wages for thy watering for us and when he cameto him and had told him his story fear not said he thou hast escapedfrom an unjust people one of them said o my father hire him for the best thou canst hire is thestrong the trusty he said truly to one of these my two daughters i desire to marry thee iffor eight years thou wilt be my hired servant and if thou fulfil ten itshall be of thine own accord for i wish not to deal hardly with thee thouwilt find me if god will one of the upright he said be it so between me and thee whichever of the two terms i fulfil there will be no injustice to me and god is witness of what we say and when moses had fulfilled the term and was journeying with his family heperceived a fire on the mountain side he said to his family wait ye for iperceive a fire haply i may bring you tidings from it or a brand from thefire to warm you and when he came up to it a voice cried to him out of the bush from theright side of the valley in the sacred hollow o moses i truly am god thelord of the worlds throw down now thy rod and when he saw it move as though it were a serpent he retreated and fled and returned not o moses cried the voice drawnear and fear not for thou art in safety put thy hand into thy bosom it shall come forth white but unharmed anddraw back thy hand to thee without fear these shall be two signs from thylord to pharaoh and his nobles for they are a perverse people he said o my lord truly i have slain one of them therefore fear i lestthey slay me my brother aaron is clearer of speech than i send him therefore with me asa help and to make good my cause for i fear lest they treat me as animpostor he said we will strengthen thine arm with thy brother and we will givepower unto you both and they shall not equal you in our signs ye twain andthey who shall follow you shall gain the day and when moses came to him with our demonstrative signs they said this isnought but magical device we never heard the like among our sires of old and moses said my lord best knoweth on whom he hath bestowed his guidance and whose shall be the recompense of the abode of paradise verily thewicked shall not prosper and pharaoh said o ye nobles ye have no other god that i know of butmyself burn me then haman bricks of clay and build me a tower that imay mount up to the god of moses for in sooth i deem him a liar and he and his hosts behaved themselves proudly and unjustly on the earth and thought that they should never be brought back to us but we seized on him and his hosts and cast them into the sea behold then the end of the wrongful doers and we made them imâms who invite to the fire of hell and on the day ofresurrection they shall not be helped we followed them with a curse in this world and covered shall they be withshame on the day of resurrection and after we had destroyed the former generations we gave the book of thelaw to moses for man s enlightening and a guidance and a mercy that haplythey might reflect and thou wast not on the western slope of sinai when we laid his charge onmoses nor wast thou one of the witnesses but we raised up generations after moses men whose days were lengthened neither didst thou dwell among the inhabitants of madian to rehearse to themour signs but we sent apostles to them nor wast thou on the slope of sinai when we called to moses but it is of themercy of thy lord that thou warnest a people to whom no warner had comebefore thee to the intent that they should reflect and that they should not say when a calamity shall befal them for theirprevious handy work o our lord why hast thou not sent an apostle to us then we should have followed thy signs and have been of the believers yet when the truth came to them from our very presence they said unlessthe like powers be given to him that were given to moses but didthey not disbelieve in what of old was given to moses they said two worksof sorcery have helped each other and they said we disbelieve themboth say bring then a book from before god which shall be a better guide thanthese that i may follow it if ye speak the truth and if they answer thee not then know that verily they are following theirown caprices and who goeth more widely astray than he who followeth his owncaprice without guidance from god for god guideth not the wicked and now have we caused our word to come unto them that they may be warned they to whom we gave the scriptures before it do in it believe and when it is recited to them they say we believe in it for it is thetruth from our lord we were muslims before it came twice shall their reward be given them for that they suffered with patience and repelled evil with good and gave alms out of that with which we providedthem and when they hear light discourse they withdraw from it and say our worksfor us and your works for you peace be on you we are not in quest offools thou truly canst not guide whom thou desirest but god guideth whom he will and he best knoweth those who yield to guidance but they say if we follow the way in which thou art guided we shall bedriven from our country but have we not established for them a sacredsecure precinct to which fruits of every kind our gift for their support are gathered together but most of them have no knowledge and how many cities have we destroyed that flourished in wanton ease andthese their dwellings have not been inhabited since their time save by a few and it is we who became their heirs but thy lord did not destroy the cities till he had sent an apostle to theirmother city to rehearse our signs to its people nor did we destroy thecities unless its people were unjust and all that hath been bestowed on you is merely for enjoyment and pomp ofthis life present but that which is with god is better and more lasting will ye not be wise shall he then to whom we have promised a goodly promise and who obtaineth it be as he on whom we have bestowed the enjoyments of this life present andwho on the day of resurrection shall be brought up for punishment on that day will god cry to them and say where are my companions as yesupposed them they on whom doom shall be justly pronounced will say o our lord these arethey whom we led astray we led them astray even as we had been led astrayourselves thou hast no cause of blame against us it was not we whom theyworshipped and it shall be said call now on those whom ye made god s companions andthey shall call on them but they will not answer them and they shall seethe punishment and wish that they had been guided aright and on that day shall god call to them and say how answered ye theapostles but on that day they shall be too blinded with confusion to give anaccount nor shall they ask it of one another yet as to him who shall turn to god and believe and do the thing that isright it may come to pass that he shall be among the happy and thy lord createth what he will and hath a free choice but they thefalse gods have no power to choose glory be to god and high let him beexalted above those whom they associate with him and thy lord knoweth what their breasts conceal and what they bring to light and he is god there is no god but he his all praise in this life and inthe next and his the power supreme and to him shall ye be brought back say what think ye if god should enshroud you with a long night until theday of resurrection what god beside god would bring you light will ye notthen hearken say what think ye if god should make it one long day for you until the dayof resurrection what god but god could bring you the night in which to takeyour rest will ye not then see of his mercy he hath made for you the night that ye may take your rest in it and the day that ye may seek what ye need out of his bounteous supplies andthat ye may give thanks one day god will call to them and say where are my companions as yesupposed them and we will bring up a witness out of every nation and say bring yourproofs and they shall know that the truth is with god alone and the godsof their own devising shall desert them now korah was of the people of moses but he behaved haughtily toward them for we had given him such treasure that its keys would have burdened acompany of men of strength when his people said to him exult not for godloveth not those who exult but seek by means of what god hath given thee to attain the future mansion and neglect not thy part in this world but be bounteous to others as godhath been bounteous to thee and seek not to commit excesses on the earth for god loveth not those who commit excesses he said it hath been given me only on account of the knowledge that is inme did he not know that god had destroyed before him generations that weremightier than he in strength and had amassed more abundant wealth but thewicked shall not be asked of their crimes and korah went forth to his people in his pomp those who were greedy forthis present life said oh that we had the like of that which hath beenbestowed on korah truly he is possessed of great good fortune but they to whom knowledge had been given said woe to you the reward ofgod is better for him who believeth and worketh righteousness and none shallwin it but those who have patiently endured and we clave the earth for him and for his palace and he had no forces inthe place of god to help him nor was he among those who are succoured and in the morning those who the day before had coveted his lot said aha god enlargeth supplies to whom he pleaseth of his servants or is sparing had not god been gracious to us he had caused it to cleave for us aha theungrateful can never prosper as to this future mansion we will bestow it on those who seek not to exaltthem in the earth or to do wrong and there is a happy issue for the god fearing whoso doeth good shall have reward beyond its merits and whoso doeth evil they who do evil shall be rewarded only as they shall have wrought he who hath sanctioned the koran to thee will certainly bring thee to thyhome say my lord best knoweth who hath guidance and who is in undoubtederror thou didst never expect that the book would be given thee of thy lord smercy only hath it been sent down be not thou helpful then to theunbelievers neither let them turn thee aside from the signs of god after they have beensent down to thee but bid men to thy lord and be not among those who addgods to god and call not on any other

without you but heis not pleased with thanklessness in his servants yet if ye be thankful hewill be pleased with you the soul burdened with its own works shall not beburdened with the burden of

calleth on him yet no sooner hath he enriched him with his favour than he forgetteth him onwhom he before had called and setteth up peers with god that he may beguileothers from his way say enjoy thou

resurrection is not this the clear ruin canopies of fire shall be over them and floors of fire beneath them withthis doth god alarm his servants fear ye me then o my servants but good tidings are there for those who shun the worship of thagout and areturned to god cheer then with good tidings those my servants who hearken tomy word and follow its excellence these are they whom god guideth and theseare men of insight him then on whom the sentence of punishment hath justly lighted him who isdoomed to the fire canst thou rescue but for those who fear their lord are storied pavilions beneath which shallthe rivers flow it is the promise of god and god will not fail in hispromise seest thou not that god sendeth down water from heaven and guideth it alongso as to form springs in the earth then bringeth forth by it corn of variedsorts then causeth he it to wither and thou seest it become yellow thencrumbleth it away lo herein is teaching for men of insight shall he then whose breast god hath opened to islam and who hath light fromhis lord but woe to those whose hearts are hardened against theremembrance of god they plainly err the best of recitals hath god sent down a book in unison

will he guide whom he pleaseth and whom god shall mislead no guide shall there be for him shall he who shall have nought but his own face to shelter him with from thetorment of the punishment on the

made them taste humiliation in this present life but greater surelywill be the punishment of the life to come did they but know it now have we set before man in this koran every kind of parable for theirwarning an arabic koran free from tortuous wording to the intent that they may feargod god setteth forth the comparison of a man with associates at variance amongthemselves and of a man devoted wholly to a man are these to be held alike no praise be to god but the greater part of them understand not thou truly shall die o muhammad and they too shall die then at the day of resurrection ye shall wrangle with one another in thepresence of your lord and who acteth more unjustly than he who lieth of god and treateth the truthwhen it cometh to him as a lie is there not a dwelling place in hell for theinfidels but he who bringeth the truth and he who believeth it to be the truth theseare the god fearing whatever they shall desire awaiteth them with their lord this is the rewardof the righteous that god may do away the guilt of their worst actions and for their bestactions render them their reward is not god all sufficient for his servant yet would they scare thee by theiridols but no guide shall there be for him whom god misleadeth and he whom god guideth shall have none to mislead him is not god all mighty able to revenge and if thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth they willsurely answer god say think ye then that they on whom ye call besidegod if god choose to afflict me could remove his affliction or if hechoose to show me mercy could they withhold his mercy say god sufficethme in him let the trusting trust say o my people act your part as best ye can i too will act mine and inthe end ye shall knowon whom shall light a punishment that shall shame him and on whom a lastingpunishment shall fall assuredly we have sent down the book to thee for man and for the ends oftruth whoso shall be guided by it it will be for his own advantage andwhoso shall err shall only err to his own loss but not to thy keeping arethey entrusted god taketh souls unto himself at death and during their sleep those who donot die and he retaineth those on which he hath passed a decree of death but sendeth the others back till a time that is fixed herein are signs forthe reflecting have they taken aught beside god as intercessors say what though they haveno power over anything neither do they understand say intercession is wholly with god his the kingdom of the heavens and ofthe earth to him shall ye be brought back hereafter but when the one god is named the hearts of those who believe not in thelife to come shrivel up but when the deities who are adored beside him arenamed lo they are filled with joy say o god creator of the heaven and of the earth who knowest the hiddenand the manifest thou shalt judge between thy servants as to the subject oftheir disputes if the wicked possessed all that is in the earth and as much again therewith verily they would ransom themselves with it from the pain of the punishmenton the day of the resurrection and there shall appear to them from god things they had never reckoned on and their own ill deeds shall be clearly perceived by them and that fire atwhich they mocked shall encircle them on every side when trouble befalleth a man he crieth to us afterwards when we havevouchsafed favour to him he saith god knew that i deserved it nay itis a trial but the greater part of them knew it not the same said those who flourished before them but their deeds profited themnot and their own ill deeds recoiled upon them and whoso among these meccans shall do wrong on them likewise their own misdeeds shall light neithershall they invalidate god know they not that god giveth supplies with open hand and that he is sparingto whom he will of a truth herein are signs to those who believe say o my servants who have transgressed to your own hurt despair not ofgod s mercy for all sins doth god forgive gracious merciful is he and return ye to your lord and to him resign yourselves ere the punishmentcome on you for then ye shall not be helped and follow that most excellent thing which hath been sent down to you fromyour lord ere the punishment come on you suddenly and when ye look not forit so that a soul say oh misery for my failures in duty towards god andverily i was of those who scoffed or say had god guided me i had surely been of those who feared him or say when it seeth the punishment could i but return then i would be ofthe righteous nay my signs had already come to thee and thou didst treat them asuntruths and wast arrogant and becamest of those who believed not and on the resurrection day thou shalt see those who have lied of god withtheir faces black is there not an abode in hell for the arrogant but god shall rescue those who fear him into their safe retreat no ill shalltouch them neither shall they be put to grief god is the creator of all things and of all things is he the guardian histhe keys of the heavens and of the earth and who believe not in the signs ofgod these they shall perish say what do ye then bid me worship other than god o ye ignorant ones but now hath it been revealed to thee and to those who flourished beforethee verily if thou join partners with god vain shall be all thy work and thyself shalt be of those who perish nay rather worship god and be of those who render thanks but they have not deemed of god as is his due for on the resurrection daythe whole earth shall be but his handful and in his right hand shall theheavens be folded together praise be to him and high be he uplifted abovethe partners they join with him and there shall be a blast on the trumpet and all who are in the heavens andall who are in the earth

and then will i tell you ofyour doings and those who shall have believed and done the things that are right we willsurely give them an entering in among the just but some men say we believe in god yet when they meet with sufferings inthe cause of god they regard trouble from man as chastisement from god yetif a success come from thy lord they are sure to say we were on your side doth not god well know what is in the breasts of his creatures yes and god well knoweth those who believe and he well knoweth thehypocrites the unbelievers say to the faithful follow ye our way and we will surelybear your sins but not aught of their sins will they bear verily they areliars but their own burdens and burdens beside their own burdens shall they surelybear and inquisition shall be made of them on the day of resurrection as totheir false devices of old sent we noah to his people a thousand years save fifty did he tarryamong them and the flood overtook them in their wrongful doings but we rescued him and those who were in the vessel and we made it a sign toall men and abraham when he said to his people worship god and fear him this willbe best for you if ye have knowledge ye only worship idols beside god and are the authors of a lie those whom yeworship beside god can give you no supplies seek then your supplies fromgod and serve him and give him thanks to him shall ye return suppose that ye treat me as a liar nations before you have treated god smessenger as a liar but open preaching is his only duty see they not how god bringeth forth creation and then causeth it to returnagain this truly is easy for god say go through the earth and see how he hath brought forth created beings hereafter with a second birth will god cause them to be born again for godis almighty whom he pleaseth will he chastise and on whom he pleaseth will he havemercy and to him shall ye be taken back and ye shall not invalidate his power either in the earth or in the heaven and save god ye shall have neither patron nor helper as for those who believe not in the signs of god or that they shall evermeet him these of my mercy shall despair and these doth a grievouschastisement await and the only answer of his people was to say slay him or burn him butfrom the fire did god save him verily herein are signs to those whobelieve and abraham said of a truth ye have taken idols along with god as your bondof union in this life present but on the day of resurrection some of you shall deny the others and some ofyou shall curse the others and your abode shall be the fire and ye shallhave none to help but lot believed on him and said i betake me to my lord for he truly isthe mighty the wise and we bestowed on him isaac and jacob and placed the gift of prophecy andthe scripture among his posterity and we gave him his reward in this world and in the next he shall be among the just we sent also lot when he said to his people proceed ye to a filthiness inwhich no people in the world hath ever gone before you proceed ye even to men attack ye them on the highway and proceed ye to thecrime in your assemblies but the only answer of his people was to say bring god s chastisement upon us if thou art a man of truth he cried my lord help me against this polluted people and when our messengers came to abraham with the tidings of a son they said of a truth we will destroy the in dwellers in this city for its in dwellersare evil doers he said lot is therein they said we know full well who therein is himand his family will we save except his wife she will be of those wholinger and when our messengers came to lot he was troubled for them and his armwas too weak to protect them and they said fear not and distress notthyself for thee and thy family will we save except thy wife she will beof those who linger we will surely bring down upon the dwellers in this city vengeance fromheaven for the excesses they have committed and in what we have left of it is a clear sign to men of understanding and to madian we sent their brother shoaib and he said oh my people worship god and expect the latter day and enact not in the land deeds ofharmful excess but they treated him as an impostor so an earthquake assailed them and atmorn they were found prostrate and dead in their dwellings and we destroyed ad and themoud already is this made plain to you in theruins of their dwellings for satan had made their own works fair seeming tothem and drew them from the right path keen sighted though they were and corah and pharaoh and haman with proofs of his mission did moses come tothem and they behaved proudly on the earth but us they could notoutstrip for every one of them did we seize in his sin against some of them didwesend a stone charged wind some of them did the terrible cry of gabrielsurprise for some of them we cleaved the earth and some of them we drowned and it was not god who would deal wrongly by them but they wrongedthemselves the likeness for those who take to themselves guardians instead of god is thelikeness of the spider who buildeth her a house but verily frailest of allhouses surely is the house of the spider did they but know this god truly knoweth all that they call on beside him and he is the mighty thewise these similitudes do we set forth to men and none understand them except thewise god hath created the heavens and the earth for a serious end verily inthis is a sign to those who believe recite the portions of the book which have been revealed to thee anddischarge the duty of prayer for prayer restraineth from the filthy and theblame worthy and the gravest duty is the remembrance of god and god knowethwhat ye do dispute not unless in kindly sort with the people of the book save withsuch of them as have dealt wrongfully with you and say ye we believe inwhat hath been sent down to us and hath been sent down to you our god andyour god is one and to him are we self surrendered muslims thus have we sent down the book of the koran to thee and they to whom wehave given the book of the law believe in it and of these arabians there arethose who believe in it and none save the infidels reject our signs thou didst not recite any book of revelation before it with that righthand of thine thou didst not transcribe one else might they who treat it asa vain thing have justly doubted but it is a clear sign in the hearts of those whom the knowledge hathreached none except the wicked reject our signs and they say unless a sign be sent down to him from his lord say signs are in the power of god alone i am only a plain spoken warner is it not enough for them that we have sent down to thee the book to berecited to them in this verily is a mercy and a warning to those whobelieve say god is witness enough between me and you he knoweth all that is in the heavens and the earth and they who believe invain things and disbelieve in god these shall be the lost ones they will challenge thee to hasten the punishment but had there not been aseason fixed for it that punishment had already come upon them but it shallovertake them suddenly when they look not for it they will challenge thee to hasten the punishment but verily hell shall beround about the infidels one day the punishment shall wrap them round both from above them and frombeneath their feet and god will say taste ye your own doings o my servants who have believed vast truly is my earth me therefore yeaworship me every soul shall taste of death then to us shall ye return but those who shall have believed and wrought righteousness will we lodge ingardens with palaces beneath which the rivers flow for ever shall theyabide therein how goodly the reward of those who labour who patiently endure and put their trust in their lord how many animals are there which provide not their own food god feedeththem and you he heareth knoweth all things if thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth and hath imposedlaws on the sun and on the moon they will certainly say god how then canthey devise lies god lavisheth supplies on such of his servants as he pleaseth or giveth tothem by measure god knoweth all things if thou ask them who sendeth rain from heaven and by it quickeneth theearth after it hath been dead they will certainly answer god say praise be to god yet most of them do not understand this present life is no other than a pastime and a disport but truly thefuture mansion is life indeed would that they knew this lo when they embark on shipboard they call upon god vowing him sincereworship but when he bringeth them safe to land behold they join partnerswith him in our revelation they believe not yet take their fill of good things butin the end they shall know their folly do they not see that we have established a safe precinct while all aroundthem men are being spoiled will they then believe in vain idols and not ownthe goodness of god but who acteth more wrongly than he who deviseth a lie against god or callsthe truth when it hath come to him a lie is there not an abode for theinfidels in hell and whoso maketh efforts for us in our ways will we guide them for god isassuredly with those

these are the verses signs of the wise book a guidance and a mercy to the righteous who observe prayer and pay the impost and believe firmly in the life tocome these rest on guidance from their lord and with these it shall be well but a man there is who buyeth an idle tale that in his lack of knowledge hemay mislead others from the way of god and turn it to scorn for such isprepared a shameful punishment and when our signs are rehearsed to him he turneth away disdainfully asthough he heard them not as though his ears were heavy with deafness announce to him therefore tidings of an afflictive punishment but they who shall have believed and wrought good works shall enjoy thegardens of delight for ever shall they dwell therein it is god s true promise and he is themighty the wise without pillars that can be seen hath he created the heavens and on theearth hath thrown mountains lest it should move with you and he hathscattered over it animals of every sort and from the heaven we send downrain and cause every kind of noble plant to grow up therein this is the creation of god shew me now what others than he have created ah the ungodly are in a manifest delusion of old we bestowed wisdom upon lokman and taught him thus be thankful togod for whoever is thankful is thankful to his own behoof and if any shallbe thankless god truly is self sufficient worthy of all praise and bear in mind when lokman said to his son by way of warning o my son join not other gods with god for the joining gods with god is the greatimpiety we have commanded man concerning his parents his mother carrieth him withweakness upon weakness nor until after two years is he weaned be gratefulto me and to thy parents unto me shall all come but if they importune thee to join that with me of which thou hast noknowledge obey them not comport thyself towards them in this world as ismeet and right but follow the way of him who turneth unto me unto me shallye return at last and then will i tell you of your doings o my son verily god will bring everything to light though it were but theweight of a grain of mustard seed and hidden in a rock or in the heavens orin the earth for god is subtile informed of all o my son observe prayer and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong and bepatient under whatever shall betide thee for this is a bounden duty and distort not thy face at men nor walk thou loftily on the earth for godloveth no arrogant vain glorious one but let thy pace be middling and lower thy voice for the least pleasing ofvoices is surely the voice of asses see ye not how that god hath put under you all that is in the heavens and allthat is on the earth and hath been bounteous to you of his favours both forsoul and body but some are there who dispute of god without knowledge andhave no guidance and no illuminating book and when it is said to them follow ye what god hath sent down they say nay that religion in which we found our fathers will we follow what though satan bid them to the torment of the flame but whoso setteth his face toward god with self surrender and is a doer ofthat which is good hath laid hold on a sure handle for unto god is theissue of all things but let not the unbelief of the unbelieving grieve thee unto us shall theyreturn then will we tell them of their doings for god knoweth the verysecrets of the breast yet a little while will we provide for them afterwards will we force them toa stern punishment if thou ask them who hath created the heavens and the earth they willcertainly reply god say god be praised but most of them have noknowledge god s whatever is in the heavens and the earth for god he is the rich the praiseworthy if all the trees that are upon the earth were to become pens and if godshould after that swell the sea into seven seas of ink his words would notbe exhausted for god is mighty wise your creation and your quickening hereafter are but as those of a singleindividual verily god heareth seeth seest thou not that god causeth the night to come in upon the day and theday to come in upon the night and that he hath subjected the sun and themoon to laws by which each speedeth along to an appointed goal and that godtherefore is acquainted with that which ye do this for that god is the truth and that whatever ye call upon beside him isa vain thing and that god he is the high the great seest thou not how the ships speed on in the sea through the favour of god that he may shew you of his signs for herein are signs to all patient grateful ones when the waves cover them like dark shadows they call upon god as withsincere religion but when he safely landeth them some of them there are whohalt between two opinions yet none reject our signs but all deceitful ungrateful ones o men fear ye your lord and dread the day whereon father shall not atonefor son neither shall a son in the least atone for his father aye the promise of god is a truth let not this present life then deceiveyou neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning god aye god with him is the knowledge of the hour and he sendeth down therain and he knoweth what is in the wombs but no soul knoweth what it shallhave gotten on the morrow neither knoweth any soul in what land it shalldie but god is knowing informed of all nothing certain is known concerning the history of this fabulist andphilosopher the opinion most generally received is that lokman is the sameperson whom the greeks not knowing his real name have called æsop i e æthiops this sura shews the high degree of respect entertained for lokman inarabia at the time of muhammad who doubtless aimed to promote the interestsof his new religion by connecting the koran with so celebrated a name see sura lxviii p beidh and itq suppose this verse to have been revealed

lords god watcheth them but thou hastthem not in thy charge it is thus moreover that we have revealed to thee an arabic koran that thoumayest warn the mother city and all around it and that thou mayest warnthem of that day of the gathering of which there is no doubt when part shallbe in paradise and part in the flame had god so pleased he had made them one people and of one creed but hebringeth whom he will within his mercy and as for the doers of evil nopatron no helper shall there be for them will they take other patrons than him but god is man s only lord hequickeneth the dead and he is mighty over all things and whatever the subject of your disputes with god doth its decision rest this is god my lord in him do i put my trust and to him do i turn inpenitence creator of the heavens and of the earth he hath given you wives from amongyour own selves and cattle male and female by this means to multiply you nought is there like him the hearer the beholder he his the keys of the heavens and of the earth he giveth with open hand orsparingly to whom he will he knoweth all things to you hath he prescribed the faith which he commanded unto noah and whichwe have revealed to thee and which we commanded unto abraham and moses andjesus saying observe this faith and be not divided into sects therein intolerable to those who worship idols jointly with godis that faith to which thou dost call them whom he pleaseth will god choosefor it and whosoever shall turn to him in penitence will he guide to it nor were they divided into sects through mutual jealousy till after that the knowledge had come to them and had not a decree from thy lord goneforth respiting them to a fixed time verily there had at once been adecision between them and they who have inherited the book after them are in perplexity of doubt concerning it for this cause summon thou them to the faith and go straight on as thou hastbeen bidden and follow not their desires and say in whatsoever books godhath sent down do i believe i am commanded to decide justly between you godis your lord and our lord we have our works and you have your works betweenus and you let there be no strife god will make us all one and to him shallwe return and as to those who dispute about god after pledges of obedience given tohim their disputings shall be condemned by their lord and wrath shall beon them and theirs shall be a sore torment it is god who hath sent down the book with truth and the balance but whoshall inform thee whether haply the hour be nigh they who believe not in it challenge its speedy coming but they whobelieve are afraid because of it and know it to be a truth are not they whodispute of the hour in a vast error benign is god towards his servants for whom he will doth he provide and heis the strong the mighty whoso will choose the harvest field of the life to come to him will we giveincrease in this his harvest field and whoso chooseth the harvest field ofthis life thereof will we give him but no portion shall there be for him inthe life to come is it that they have gods who have sanctioned for them aught in the matter ofreligion which god hath not allowed but had it not been for a decree ofrespite till the day of severance judgment had ere now taken place amongthem and assuredly the impious shall undergo a painful torment on that day thou shalt see the impious alarmed at their own works and theconsequence thereof shall fall upon them but they who believe and do thethings that are right shall dwell in the meadows of paradise whatever theyshall desire awaiteth them with their lord this the greatest boon this is what god announceth to his servants who believe and do the thingsthat are right say for this ask i no wage of you save the love of my kin and whoever shall have won the merit of a good deed we will increase good tohim therewith for god is forgiving grateful will they say he hath forged a lie of god if god pleased he could then seal up thy very heart but god will bring untruth to nought and will make good the truth by his word for he knoweth the very secrets ofthe breast he it is who accepteth repentance from his servants and forgiveth their sinsand knoweth your actions and to those who believe and do the things that are right will he hearken and augment his bounties to them but the unbelievers doth a terriblepunishment await should god bestow abundance upon his servants they might act wantonly on theearth but he sendeth down what he will by measure for he knoweth beholdethhis servants he it is who after that men have despaired of it sendeth down the rain andspreadeth abroad his mercy he is the protector the praiseworthy among his signs is the creation of the heavens and of the earth and thecreatures which he hath scattered over both and for their gatheringtogether when he will he is allpowerful nor happeneth to you any mishap but it is for your own handy work and yethe forgiveth many things ye cannot weaken him on the earth neither beside god patron or helpershall ye have among his signs also are the sea traversing ships like mountains if such behis will he lulleth the wind and they lie motionless on the back of thewaves truly herein are signs to all the constant the grateful or if for their ill deserts he cause them to founder still he forgivethmuch but they who gainsay our signs shall know that there will be no escape forthem all that you receive is but for enjoyment in this life present but betterand more enduring is a portion with god for those who believe and put theirtrust in their lord and who avoid the heinous things of crime and filthiness and when they areangered forgive and who hearken to their lord and observe prayer and whose affairs areguided by mutual counsel and who give alms of that with which we haveenriched them and who when a wrong is done them redress themselves yet let the recompense of evil be only a like evil but he who forgiveth andis reconciled shall be rewarded by god himself for he loveth not those whoact unjustly and there shall be no way open against those who after being wronged avengethemselves but there shall be a way open against those who unjustly wrong others andact insolently on the earth in disregard of justice these a grievouspunishment doth await them and whoso beareth wrongs with patience and forgiveth this verily is abounden duty but he whom god shall cause to err shall thenceforth have no protector andthou shalt behold the perpetrators of injustice exclaiming when they see the torment is there no way to return and thou shalt see them when set before it downcast for the shame theyshall look at it with stealthy glances and the believers shall say trulyare the losers they who have lost themselves and their families on the day ofresurrection shall not the perpetrators of injustice be in lasting torment and no other protectors shall there be to succour them than god and nopathway for him whom god shall cause to err hearken then to your lord ere the day come which none can put back when goddoth ordain its coming no place of refuge for you on that day no denyingyour own works but if they turn aside from thee yet we have not sent thee to be theirguardian tis thine but to preach when we cause man to taste our gifts ofmercy he rejoiceth in it but if for their by gone handy work evil betidethem then lo is man ungrateful god s the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth he createth what he will and he giveth daughters to whom he will and sons to whom he will or he giveth them children of both sexes and he maketh whom he will to bechildless for he is wise powerful it is not for man that god should speak with him but by vision or frombehind a veil or he sendeth a messenger to reveal by his permission what he will for heis exalted wise thus have we sent the spirit gabriel to thee with a revelation by ourcommand thou knewest not ere this what the book was or what the faith but we have ordained it for a light by it will we guide whom we please ofour servants and thou shalt surely guide into the right way the way of god whose is all that the heaven and the earth contain shall notall things

notreflect unto him shall ye return all together the promise of god is sure heproduceth a creature then causeth it to return again that he may rewardthose who believe and do the things that are right with equity but as forthe infidels for them the draught that boileth and an afflictive torment because they have not believed it is he who hath appointed the sun for brightness and the moon for a light and hath ordained her stations that ye may learn the number of years and thereckoning of time god hath not created all this but for the truth hemaketh his signs clear to those who understand verily in the alternations of night and of day and in all that god hathcreated in the heavens and in the earth are signs to those who fear him verily they who hope not to meet us and find their satisfaction in thisworld s life and rest on it and who of our signs are heedless these their abode the fire in recompense of their deeds but they who believe and do the things that are right shall their lorddirect aright because of their faith rivers shall flow at their feet ingardens of delight their cry therein glory be to thee o god and their salutation therein peace and the close of their cry praise be to god lord of all creatures should god hasten evil on men as they fain would hasten their good then weretheir end decreed so leave we those who hope not to meet us bewildered intheir error when trouble toucheth a man he crieth to us on his side or sitting orstanding and when we withdraw his trouble from him he passeth on as thoughhe had not called on us against the trouble which touched him thus are thedeeds of transgressors pre arranged for them and of old destroyed we generations before you when they had acted wickedly and their apostles had come to them with clear tokens of their mission andthey would not believe thus reward we the wicked then we caused you to succeed them on the earth that we might see how yewould act but when our clear signs are recited to them they who look not forward tomeet us say bring a different koran from this or make some change in it say it is not for me to change it as mine own soul prompteth i follow onlywhat is revealed to me verily i fear if i rebel against my lord thepunishment of a great day say had god so pleased i had not recited it to you neither had i taught itto you already have i dwelt among you for years ere it was revealed to me understand ye not and who is more unjust than he who coineth a lie against god or treateth hissigns as lies surely the wicked shall not prosper and they worship beside god what cannot hurt or help them and say theseare our advocates with god say will ye inform god of aught in the heavensand in the earth which he knoweth not praise be to him high be he exaltedabove the deities they join with him men were of one religion only then they fell to variance and had not adecree of respite previously gone forth from thy lord their differenceshad surely been decided between them they say unless a sign be sent down to him from his lord but say the hidden is only with god wait therefore i truly will be with you amongthose who wait and when after a trouble which you befallen them we caused this people totaste of mercy lo a plot on their part against our signs say swifter toplot is god verily our messengers note down your plottings he it is who enableth you to travel by land and sea so that ye go on boardof ships which sail on with them with favouring breeze in which theyrejoice but if a tempestuous gale overtake them and the billow come on themfrom every side and they think that they are encompassed therewith theycall on god professing sincere religion wouldst thou but rescue us fromthis then will we indeed be of the thankful but when we have rescued them lo they commit unrighteous excesses on theearth o men assuredly your self injuring excess is only an enjoyment ofthis life present soon ye return to us and we will let you know what yehave done verily this present life is like the water which we send down from heaven and the produce of the earth of which men and cattle eat is mingled withit till the earth hath received its golden raiment and is decked out andthey who dwell on it deem that they have power over it but our behestcometh to it by night or by day and we make it as if it had been mown as ifit had not teemed only yesterday thus make we our signs clear to those whoconsider and god calleth to the abode of peace and he guideth whom he will into theright way goodness itself and an increase of it for those who do good neitherblackness nor shame shall cover their faces these shall be the inmates ofparadise therein shall they abide for ever and as for those who have wrought out evil their recompense shall be evil oflike degree and shame shall cover them no protector shall they have againstgod as though their faces were darkened with deep murk of night these shallbe inmates of the fire therein they shall abide for ever and on that day will we gather them all together then will we say to thosewho added gods to god to your place ye and those added gods of yours then we will separate between them and those their gods shall say yeserved us not and god is a sufficient witness between us and you we cared not aught foryour worship there shall every soul make proof of what itself shall have sent on before and they shall be brought back to god their true lord and the deities oftheir own devising shall vanish from them say who supplieth you from the heaven and the earth who hath power overhearing and sight and who bringeth forth the living from the dead andbringeth forth the dead from the living and who ruleth all things they willsurely say god then say what will ye not therefore fear him this god then is your true lord and when the truth is gone what remainethbut error how then are ye so perverted thus is the word of thy lord made good on the wicked that they shall notbelieve say is there any of the gods whom ye add to god who produceth a creature then causeth it to return to him say god produceth a creature then causethit to return to him how therefore are ye turned aside say is there any of the gods ye add to god who guideth into the truth say god guideth into the truth is he then who guideth into the truth the moreworthy to be followed or he who guideth not unless he be himself guided what then hath befallen you that ye so judge and most of them follow only a conceit but a conceit attaineth to nought oftruth verily god knoweth what they say moreover this koran could not have been devised by any but god but itconfirmeth what was revealed before it and is a clearing up of thescriptures there is no doubt thereof from the lord of all creatures do they say he hath devised it himself say then bring a sura like it and call on whom ye can beside god if ye speak truth but that which they embrace not in their knowledge have they charged withfalsehood though the explanation of it had not yet been given them so thosewho were before them brought charges of imposture but see what was the endof the unjust and some of them believe in it and some of them believe not in it but thylord well knoweth the transgressors and if they charge thee with imposture then say my work for me and yourwork for you ye are clear of that which i do and i am clear of that whichye do and some of them lend a ready ear to thee but wilt thou make the deaf tohear even though they understand not and some of them look at thee but wilt thou guide the blind even though theysee not verily god will not wrong men in aught but men will wrong themselves moreover on that day he will gather them all together they shall seem asthough they had waited but an hour of the day they shall recognise oneanother now perish they who denied the meeting with god and were not guidedaright whether we cause thee to see some of our menaces against them fulfilled orwhether we first take thee to ourself to us do they return then shall godbear witness of what they do and every people hath had its apostle and when their apostle came arightful decision took place between them and they were not wronged yet they say when will this menace be made good tell us if ye speaktruly say i have no power over my own weal or woe but as god pleaseth everypeople hath its time when their time is come they shall neither retard noradvance it an hour say how think ye if god s punishment came on you by night or by day whatportion of it would the wicked desire to hasten on when it falleth on you will ye believe it then yes ye will believe

them whether this be true say yes by mylord it is the truth and it is not ye who can weaken him and every soul that hath sinned if it possessed all that is on earth wouldassuredly ransom itself therewith and they will proclaim their repentancewhen they have seen the punishment and there shall be a rightful decisionbetween them and they shall not be unjustly dealt with is not whatever is in the heavens and the earth god s is not then thepromise of god true yet most of them know it not he maketh alive and he causeth to die and to him shall ye return o men now hath a warning come to you from your lord and a medicine for whatis in your breasts and a guidance and a mercy to believers say through the grace of god and his mercy and in this therefore let themrejoice better is this than all ye amass say what think ye of what god hath sent down to you for food have ye madeunlawful and lawful say hath god permitted you or invent ye on the part ofgod but what on the day of resurrection will be the thought of those who invent alie on the part of god truly god is full of bounties to man but most ofthem give not thanks thou shalt not be employed in affairs nor shalt thou read a text out of thekoran nor shall ye work any work but we will be witnesses over you when yeare engaged therein and not the weight of an atom on earth or in heavenescapeth thy lord nor is there aught that is less than this or greater butit is in the perspicuous book are not the friends of god those on whom no fear shall come nor shall theybe put to grief they who believe and fear god for them are good tidings in this life and in the next there is no changein the words of god this the great felicity and let not their discourse grieve thee for all might is god s the hearer the knower he is not whoever is in the heavens and the earth subject to god what then dothey follow who beside god call upon deities they have joined with him they follow but a conceit and they are but liars it is he who hath ordained for you the night wherein to rest and thelightsome day verily in this are signs for those who hearken they say god hath begotten children no by his glory he is the self sufficient all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth is his have ye warranty for that assertion what speak ye of god that which ye knownot say verily they who devise this lie concerning god shall fare ill a portion have they in this world then to us they return then make we themto taste the vehement torment for that they were unbelievers recite to them the history of noah when he said to his people if o mypeople my abode with you and my reminding you of the signs of god begrievous to you yet in god is my trust muster therefore your designs andyour false gods and let not your design be carried on by you in the dark then come to some decision about me and delay not and if ye turn your backs on me yet ask i no reward from you my reward iswith god alone and i am commanded to be of the muslims but they treated him as a liar therefore we rescued him and those who werewith him in the ark and we made them to survive the others and we drownedthose who charged our signs with falsehood see then what was the end ofthese warned ones then after him we sent apostles to their peoples and they came to them withcredentials but they would not believe in what they had denied aforetime thus seal we up the hearts of the transgressors then sent we after them moses and aaron to pharaoh and his nobles with oursigns but they acted proudly and were a wicked people and when the truth came to them from us they said verily this is clearsorcery moses said what say ye of the truth after it hath come to you is thissorcery but sorcerers shall not prosper they said art thou come to us to pervert us from the faith in which wefound our fathers and that you twain shall bear rule in this land but webelieve you not and pharaoh said fetch me every skilled magician and when the magiciansarrived moses said to them cast down what ye have to cast and when they had cast them down moses said verily god will render vainthe sorceries which ye have brought to pass god prospereth not the work ofthe evildoers and by his words will god verify the truth though the impious be averse toit and none believed on moses but a race among his own people through fear ofpharaoh and his nobles lest he should afflict them for of a truth mightywas pharaoh in the land and one who committed excesses and moses said o my people if ye believe in god then put your trust inhim if ye be muslims and they said in god put we our trust o our lord abandon us not to trialfrom that unjust people and deliver us by thy mercy from the unbelieving people then thus revealed we to moses and to his brother provide houses for yourpeople in egypt and in your houses make a kebla and observe prayer andproclaim good tidings to the believers and moses said o our lord thou hast indeed given to pharaoh and his noblessplendour and riches in this present life o our lord that they may err fromthy way o our lord confound their riches and harden their hearts that theymay not believe till they see the dolorous torment he said the prayer of you both is heard pursue ye both therefore thestraight path and follow not the path of those who have no knowledge and we led the children of israel through the sea and pharaoh and his hostsfollowed them in eager and hostile sort until when the drowning overtookhim he said i believe that there is no god but he on whom the children ofisrael believe and i am one of the muslims yes now said god but thou hast been rebellious hitherto and wast oneof the wicked doers but this day will we rescue thee with thy body that thou mayest be a sign tothose who shall be after thee but truly most men are of our signsregardless moreover we prepared a settled abode for the children of israel and providedthem with good things nor did they fall into variance till the knowledge the law came to them truly thy lord will decide between them on the day ofresurrection concerning that in which they differed and if thou art in doubt as to what we have sent down to thee inquire atthose who have read the scriptures before thee now hath the truth comeunto thee from thy lord be not therefore of those who doubt neither be of those who charge the signs of god with falsehood lest thou beof those who perish verily they against whom the decree of thy lord is pronounced shall notbelieve even though every kind of sign come unto them till they behold the doloroustorment were it otherwise any city had it believed might have found its safety inits faith but it was so only with the people of jonas when they believed we delivered them from the penalty of shame in this world and provided forthem for a time but if thy lord had pleased verily all who are in the earth would havebelieved together what wilt thou compel men to become believers no soul can believe but by the permission of god and he shall lay his wrathon those who will not understand say consider ye whatever is in the heavens and on the earth but neithersigns nor warners avail those who will not believe what then can they expect but the like of such days of wrath as befel thosewho flourish before them say wait i too will wait with you then will we deliver our apostles and those who believe thus is it bindingon us to deliver the faithful say o men if ye are in doubt as to my religion verily i worship not whatye worship beside god but i worship god who will cause you to die and i amcommanded to be a believer and set thy face toward true religion sound in faith and be not of thosewho join other gods with god neither invoke beside god that which can neither help nor hurt thee for ifthou do thou wilt certainly then be one of those who act unjustly and if god lay the touch of trouble on thee none can deliver thee from itbut he and if he will thee any good none can keep back his boons he willconfer them on such of his servants as he chooseth and he is the gracious the merciful say o men now hath the truth come unto you from your lord he therefore whowill be guided will be guided only for his own behoof but he who shall errwill err only against it and i am not your guardian and follow what is revealed to thee and persevere steadfastly till god shalljudge for he is the best of judges see sura xviii n p that is for a serious

may reward those who have believed and done the thingsthat are right pardon and a noble provision shall they receive but as for those who aim to invalidate our signs a chastisement of painfultorment awaiteth them and they to whom knowledge hath been given see that what hath been sent downto thee from thy lord is the truth and that it guideth into the way of theglorious one the praiseworthy but the unbelievers say to those whom they fall in with shall we shew you aman who will foretell you that when ye shall have been utterly torn and rentto pieces ye shall be restored in a new form he deviseth a lie about god or there is a djinn in him but they whobelieve not in the next life shall incur the chastisement and be lost inthe mazes of estrangement from god what have they never contemplated that which is before them and behind them the heaven and the earth if such were our pleasure we could sink them intothat earth or cause a portion of that heaven to fall upon them herein trulyis a sign for our every returning servant of old bestowed we on david a gift our special boon ye mountains and yebirds answer his songs of praise and we made the iron soft for him makecoats of mail and arrange its plates and work ye righteousness for ibehold your actions and unto solomon did we subject the wind which travelled in the morning amonth s journey and a month s journey in the evening and we made a fountainof molten brass to flow for him and of the djinn were some who worked in hispresence by the will of his lord and such of them as swerved from ourbidding will we cause to taste the torment of the flame they made for him whatever he pleased of lofty halls and images and disheslarge as tanks for watering camels and cooking pots that stood firmly work said we o family of david with thanksgiving but few of myservants are the thankful and when we decreed the death of solomon nothing shewed them that he wasdead but a reptile of the earth that gnawed the staff which supported hiscorpse and when it fell the djinn perceived that if they had known thethings unseen they had not continued in this shameful affliction a sign there was to saba in their dwelling places two gardens the one onthe right hand and the other on the left eat ye of your lord s supplies and give thanks to him goodly is the country and gracious is the lord but they turned aside so we sent upon them the flood of irem and wechanged them their gardens into two gardens of bitter fruit and tamarisk andsome few jujube trees such was our retribution on them for their ingratitude but do we thusrecompense any except the ungrateful and we placed between them and the cities which we have blessed conspicuouscities and we fixed easy stages travel ye through them by night and day secure but they said o lord make the distance between our journeys longer andagainst themselves did they act unjustly so we made them a tale andscattered them with an utter scattering truly herein are signs to everyonethat is patient grateful and eblis found that he had judged truly of them and they all except aremnant of the faithful followed him yet no power had he over them only we would discern him who believed in thelife to come from him who doubted of it for thy lord watcheth all things say call ye upon those whom ye deem gods beside god their power in theheavens and in the earth is not the weight of an atom neither have they anyshare in either nor hath he a helper from among them no intercession shall avail with him but that which he shall himself allow until when at last their hearts shall be relieved from terror they shallsay what saith your lord they shall say the truth and he is the high the great say who supplieth you out of the heavens and the earth say god and eitherwe or ye have guidance or are in palpable error say not as to our faults shall ye be questioned neither shall we bequestioned as to your actions say our lord will gather us together then will he judge between us injustice for he is the judge the knowing say shew me those whom ye have united with him as associates nay rather he is god the mighty the wise and we have sent thee to mankind at large to announce and to threaten butmost men understand not and they say when will this threat come to pass tell us if ye be men oftruth say ye are menaced with a day which not for an hour shall ye retard orhasten on the unbelievers say we will not believe in this koran nor in the bookswhich preceded it but couldst thou see when the wicked shall be set beforetheir lord with reproaches will they answer one another the weak shall sayto the mighty ones but for you we had been believers then shall the mighty ones say to the weak what was it we who turned youaside from the guidance which had reached you nay but ye acted wickedlyyourselves and the weak shall say to the mighty ones nay but there was a plot bynight and by day when ye bad us believe not in god and gave him peers andthey shall proclaim their repentance after they have seen the punishment andyokes will we place on the necks of those who have not believed shall theybe rewarded but as they have wrought and never have we sent a warner to any city whose opulent men did not say in sooth we disbelieve your message and they said we are the more abundant in riches and in children nor shallwe be among the punished say of a truth my lord will be liberal or sparing in his supplies to whom hepleaseth but the greater part of men acknowledge it not neither by your riches nor by your children shall you bring yourselves intonearness with us but they who believe and do the thing that is right shallhave a double reward for what they shall have done and in the pavilions ofparadise shall they dwell secure but they who shall aim to invalidate our signs shall be consigned topunishment say of a truth my lord will be liberal in supplies to whom he pleaseth ofhis servants or will be sparing to him and whatever ye shall give in almshe will return and he is the best dispenser of gifts one day he will gather them all together then shall he say to the angels did these worship you they shall say glory be to thee thou art our master not these but theyworshipped the djinn it was in them that most of them believed on this day the one of you shall have no power over others for help or hurt and we will say to the evil doers taste ye the torment of the fire whichye treated as a delusion for when our distinct signs are recited to them they say this is merely aman who would fain pervert you from your father s worship and they say this koran is no other than a forged falsehood and the unbelievers sayto the truth when it is presented to them tis nothing but palpablesorcery yet have we given them no books in which to study deeply nor have we sentany one to them before thee charged with warnings they also flourished before them treated our apostles as impostors in likesort but not to the tenth part of what we bestowed on them have theseattained and yet when they charged my apostles with deceit how terrible wasmy vengeance say one thing in sooth do i advise you that ye stand up before god two andtwo or singly and then reflect that in your fellow citizen is no djinn he is no other than your warner before a severe punishment say i ask not any wage from you keep it for yourselves my wage is from godalone and he is witness over all things say truly my lord sendeth forth the truth knower of things unseen say truth is come and falsehood shall vanish and return no more say if i err verily to my own cost only shall i err but if i haveguidance it will be of my lord s revealing for he is the hearer the nearat hand couldst thou see how they shall tremble and find no escape and be takenforth from the place that is so near and shall say we believe in him but how in their present distance shallthey receive the faith when they had before denied it and aimed their shafts at the mysteries fromafar and a gulf shall be

judgment free from the influence of others it is very remarkable that when the power of muhammad became firmlyestablished he never reverts to the insinuations against the soundness ofhis mind which in the earlier suras he so often rebuts that is their graves mar so called because there is but a step into itfrom the surface of the earth ullm that is when in this life sura xxxv the creator or the

ye turned aside from him if they treat thee as an impostor then before thee have apostles beentreated as impostors but to god shall all things return o men assuredly the promise of god is true let not

good be treated like him who seeth things aright verily god misleadethwhom he will and guideth whom he will spend not thy soul in sighs for them god knoweth their doings it is god who sendeth forth the winds which raise the clouds aloft thendrive we them on to some land dead from drought and give life thereby tothe earth after its death so shall be the resurrection if any one desireth greatness all greatness is in god the good word risethup to him and the righteous deed will he exalt but a severe punishmentawaiteth the plotters of evil things and the plots of such will he rendervain moreover god created you of dust then of the germs of life then made you twosexes and no female conceiveth or bringeth forth without his knowledge andthe aged ageth not nor is aught minished from man s age but in accordancewith the book an easy thing truly is this to god nor are the two seas alike the one fresh sweet pleasant for drink andthe other salt bitter yet from both ye eat fresh fish and take forth foryou ornaments to wear and thou seest the ships cleaving their waters that yemay go in quest of his bounties and that ye may be thankful he causeth the night to enter in upon the day and the day to enter in uponthe night and he hath given laws to the sun and to the moon so that eachjourneyeth to its appointed goal this is god your lord all power is his but the gods whom ye call on beside him have no power over the husk of a datestone if ye cry to them they will not hear your cry and if they heard they wouldnot answer you and in the day of resurrection they will disown your joiningthem with god and none can instruct thee like him who is informed of all o men ye are but paupers in need of god but god is the rich thepraiseworthy if he please he could sweep you away and bring forth a new creation nor will this be hard for god and the burdened soul shall not bear the burden of another and if the heavyladen soul cry out for its burden to be carried yet shall not aught of it becarried even by the near of kin thou shalt warn those who fear their lordin secret and observe prayer and whoever shall keep himself pure hepurifieth himself to his own behoof for unto god shall be the finalgathering and the blind and the seeing are not alike neither darkness and light northe shade and the hot wind nor are the living and the dead the same thing god indeed shall make whom hewill to hearken but thou shalt not make those who are in their graves tohearken for only with warning art thou charged verily we have sent thee with the truth a bearer of good tidings and awarner nor hath there been a people unvisited by its warner and if they treat thee as a liar so did those who were before them threattheir apostles who came to them with the proofs of their mission and withthe scriptures and with the enlightening book then chastised i the unbelievers and how great was my vengeance seest thou not how that god sendeth down water from the heaven and that byit we cause the up growth of fruits of varied hues and that on themountains are tracks of varied hues white and red and others are of araven black and of men and reptiles and animals various likewise are thehues such only of his servants as are possessed of knowledge fear god lo god is mighty gracious verily they who recite the book of god and observe prayer and give alms inpublic and in private from what we have bestowed upon them may hope for amerchandise that shall not perish god will certainly pay them their due wages and of his bounty increase them for he is gracious grateful and that which we have revealed to thee of the book is the very truth confirmatory of previous scriptures for god knoweth and beholdeth hisservants moreover we have made the book an heritage to those of our servants whom wehave chosen some of them injure themselves by evil deeds others keep themidway between good and evil and others by the permission of god outstripin goodness this is the great merit into the gardens of eden shall they enter with bracelets of gold and pearlshall they be decked therein and therein shall their raiment be of silk and they shall say praise be to god who hath put away sorrow from us verily our lord is gracious grateful who of his bounty hath placed us in a manison that shall abide for ever therein no toil shall reach us and therein no weariness shall touch us but for infidels is the fire of hell to die shall never be decreed them norshall aught of its torment be made light to them thus reward we everyinfidel and therein shall they cry aloud take us hence o our lord righteousnesswill we work and not what we wrought of old prolonged we not your daysthat whoever would be warned might be warned therein and the preacher cameto you taste it then there is no protector for the unjust god truly knoweth the hidden things both of the heavens and of the earth forhe knoweth the very secrets of the breast he hath appointed you his vicegerents in the earth and whoever believethnot on him shall be his unbelief and their unbelief shall only increase forthe unbelievers hatred at the hands of their lord and their unbelief shallonly increase for the unbelievers their own perdition say what think ye of the gods whom ye invoke beside god shew me what partof the earth they have created had they a share in the creation of theheavens have we given them a book in which they can find proofs that theyare to be called on nay the wicked promise one another only deceits verily god holdeth fast the heavens and the earth that they pass not away and if they were passing away none could hold them back but he for he iskind gracious they swore by god with their mightiest oath that should a preacher come tothem they would yield to guidance more than any people but when the preachercame to them it only increased in them their estrangement their haughtiness on earth and their plotting of evil but the plotting ofevil shall only enmesh those who make use of it look they then for aughtbut god s way of dealing with the peoples of old thou shalt not find anychange in the way of god yea thou shalt not find any variableness in the way of god have they never journeyed in the land and seen what hath been the end ofthose who flourished before them though mightier in strength than they godis not to be frustrated by aught in the heavens or in the earth for he isthe all knowing the all mighty if moreover god should chastise men according to their deserts he wouldnot leave even a reptile on the back of the earth but to an appointed timedoth he respite them and when their time shall come then verily god s eye is on his servants see note at sura xcvii iii this is one of the passages said to haveoriginated with zayd not only seas properly so called but the great masses of fresh water inthe nile tigris inland lakes etc the gospel this idea was probably suggested by muhammad s reminiscences of the viewfrom the cave of hira to the north and west of which there

sad a book hath been sent down to thee therefore let therebe no difficulty in thy breast concerning it to the intent that thou mayestwarn thereby and that it may be a monition to the faithful follow ye what hath been sent down to you from your lord and follow nomasters beside him how little will ye be monished how many cities have we destroyed by night or while they were in theirmidday slumber did our wrath reach them and what was their cry when our wrath reached them but to say verily wehave been impious surely therefore will we call those to account to whom an apostle hathbeen sent and of the sent ones themselves will we certainly demand areckoning and with knowledge will we tell them of their deeds for we were not absentfrom them the weighing on that day with justice and they whose balances shall beheavy these are they who shall be happy and they whose balances shall be light these are they who have lost theirsouls for that to our signs they were unjust and now have we stabilished you on the earth and given you therein thesupports of life how little do ye give thanks we created you then fashioned you then said we to the angels prostrateyourselves unto adam and they prostrated them all in worship save eblis hewas not among those who prostrated themselves to him said god what hath hindered thee from prostrating thyself in worshipat my bidding he said nobler am i than he me hast thou created of fire of clay hast thou created him he said get thee down hence paradise is no place for thy pride get theegone then one of the despised shalt thou be he said respite me till the day when mankind shall be raised from thedead he said one of the respited shalt thou be he said now for that thou hast caused me to err surely in thy straightpath will i lay wait for them then will i surely come upon them from before and from behind and fromtheir right hand and from their left and thou shalt not find the greaterpart of them to be thankful he said go forth from it a scorned a banished one whoever of them shallfollow thee i will surely fill hell with you one and all and o adam dwell thou and thy wife in paradise and eat ye whence ye will but to this tree approach not lest ye become of the unjust doers then satan whispered them to shew them their nakedness which had been hiddenfrom them both and he said this tree hath your lord forbidden you onlylest ye should become angels or lest ye should become immortals and he sware to them both verily i am unto you one who counselleth aright so he beguiled them by deceits and when they had tasted of the tree theirnakedness appeared to them and they began to sew together upon themselvesthe leaves of the garden and their lord called to them did i not forbidyou this tree and did i not say to you verily satan is your declaredenemy they said o our lord with ourselves have we dealt unjustly if thouforgive us not and have pity on us we shall surely be of those who perish he said get ye down the one of you an enemy to the other and on earthshall be your dwelling and your provision for a season he said on it shall ye live and on it shall ye die and from it shall yebe taken forth o children of adam now have we sent down to you raiment to hide yournakedness and splendid garments but the raiment of piety this is best thisis one of the signs of god that man haply may reflect o children of adam let not satan bring you into trouble as he drove forthyour parents from the garden by despoiling them of their raiment that hemight cause them to see their nakedness he truly seeth you he and hiscomrades whence ye see not them verily we have made the satans tutelars ofthose who believe not and when the wicked commit some filthy deed they say we found our fatherspractising it and to us hath god commanded it say god enjoineth not filthydeeds will ye speak of god ye know not what say my lord hath enjoined what is right turn your faces therefore towardsevery place where he is worshipped and call upon him with sincere religion as he created you to him shall ye return some hath he guided and some hathhe justly left in error because they have taken the satans as their tutelarsbeside god and have deemed that they were guided aright o children of adam wear your goodly apparel when ye repair to any mosque and eat ye and drink but exceed not for he loveth not those who exceed say who hath prohibited god s goodly raiment and the healthful viands whichhe hath provided for his servants say these are for the faithful in thispresent life but above all on the day of the resurrection thus make we oursigns plain for people of knowledge say truly my lord hath forbidden filthy actions whether open or secret andiniquity and unjust violence and to associate with god that for which hehath sent down no warranty and to speak of god that ye know not every nation hath its set time and when their time is come they shall notretard it an hour and they shall not advance it o children of adam there shall come to you apostles from among yourselves rehearsing my signs to you and whoso shall fear god and do good works nofear shall be upon them neither shall they be put to grief but they who charge our signs with falsehood and turn away from them intheir pride shall be inmates of the fire for ever shall they abide therein and who is worse than he who deviseth a lie of god or treateth our signs aslies to them shall a portion here below be assigned in accordance with thebook of our decrees until the time when our messengers as they receivetheir souls shall say where are they on whom ye called beside god theyshall say gone from us and they shall witness against themselves thatthey were infidels he shall say enter ye into the fire with the generations of djinn and menwho have preceded you so oft as a fresh generation entereth it shall curseits sister until when they have all reached it the last comers shall say tothe former o our lord these are they who led us astray assign themtherefore a double torment of the fire he will say ye shall all havedouble but of this are ye ignorant and the former of them shall say to the latter what advantage have ye overus taste ye therefore the torment for that which ye have done verily they who have charged our signs with falsehood and have turned awayfrom them in their pride heaven s gates shall not be opened to them norshall they enter paradise until the camel passeth through the eye of theneedle after this sort will we recompense the transgressors they shall make their bed in hell and above them shall be coverings of fire after this sort will we recompense the evil doers but as to those who have believed and done the things which are right wewill lay on no one a burden beyond his power these shall be inmates ofparadise for ever shall they abide therein and we will remove whatever rancour was in their bosoms rivers shall roll attheir feet and they shall say praise be to god who hath guided us hither we had not been guided had not god guided us of a surety the apostles of ourlord came to us with truth and a voice shall cry to them this isparadise of which as the meed of your works ye are made heirs and the inmates of paradise shall cry to the inmates of the fire now havewe found what our lord promised us to be true have ye too found what yourlord promised you to be true and they shall answer yes and a heraldshall proclaim between them the curse of god be upon the evil doers who turn men aside from the way of god and seek to make it crooked and whobelieve not in the life to come and between them shall be a partition and on the wall al araf shall be menwho will know all by their tokens and they shall cry to the inmates ofparadise peace be on you but they shall not yet enter it although theylong to do so and when their eyes are turned towards the inmates of the fire they shallsay o our lord place us not with the offending people and they who are upon al araf shall cry to those whom they shall know bytheir tokens your amassings and your pride have availed you nothing are these they on whom ye sware god would not bestow mercy enter ye intoparadise where no fear shall be upon you neither shall ye be put to grief and the inmates of the fire shall cry to the inmates of paradise pour uponus some water or of the refreshments god hath given you they shall say truly god hath forbidden both to unbelievers who made their religion a sport and pastime and whom the life of the worldhath deceived this day therefore will we forget them as they forgot themeeting of this their day and as they did deny our signs and now have we brought them the book with knowledge have we explained it aguidance and a mercy to them that believe what have they to wait for now but its interpretation when itsinterpretation shall come they who aforetime were oblivious of it shallsay the prophets of our lord did indeed bring the truth shall we have anyintercessor to intercede for us or could we not be sent back then would weact otherwise than we have acted but they have ruined themselves and thedeities of their own devising have fled from them your lord is god who in six days created the heavens and the earth and thenmounted the throne he throweth the veil of night over the day it pursuethit swiftly and he created the sun and the moon and the stars subjected tolaws by his behest is not all creation and its empire his blessed be godthe lord of the worlds call upon your lord with lowliness and in secret for he loveth nottransgressors and commit not disorders on the earth after it hath been well ordered andcall on him with fear and longing desire verily the mercy of god is nighunto the righteous and he it is who sendeth forth the winds as the heralds of his compassion until they bring up the laden clouds which we drive along to some dead landand send down water thereon by which we cause an upgrowth of all kinds offruit thus will we bring forth the dead haply ye will reflect in a rich soil its plants spring forth abundantly by the will of its lord and in that which is bad they spring forth but scantily thus do wediversify our signs for those who are thankful of old sent we noah to his people and he said o my people worship god ye have no god but him indeed i fear for you the chastisement of the greatday the chiefs of his people said we clearly see that thou art in a palpableerror he said there is no error in me o my people but i am a messenger from thelord of the worlds i bring to you the messages of my lord and i give you friendly counsel fori know from god what ye know not marvel ye that a warning should come to you from your lord through one ofyourselves that he may warn you and that ye may fear for yourselves andthat haply ye may find mercy but they treated him as a liar so we delivered him and those who were withhim in the ark and we drowned those who charged our signs with falsehood for they were a blind people and to ad we sent their brother houd o my people said he worshipgod ye have no other god than him will ye not then fear him said the unbelieving chiefs among his people we certainly perceive thatthou art unsound of mind and we surely deem thee an impostor he said o my people it is not unsoundness of mind in me but i am anapostle from the lord of the worlds the messages of my lord do i announce to you and i am your faithfulcounsellor marvel ye that a warning hath come to you from your lord through one ofyourselves that he may warn you remember how he hath made you the successorsof the people of noah and increased you in tallness of stature rememberthen the favours of god that it may haply be well with you they said art thou come to us in order that we may worship one god alone and leave what our fathers worshipped then bring that upon us with whichthou threatenest us if thou be a man of truth he said vengeance and wrath shall suddenly light on you from your lord doye dispute with me about names that you and your fathers have given youridols and for which god hath sent you down no warranty wait ye then and itoo will wait with you and we delivered him and those who were on his side by our mercy and wecut off to the last man those who had treated our signs as lies and whowere not believers and to themoud we sent their brother saleh he said o my people worshipgod ye have no other god than him now hath a clear proof of my mission cometo you from your lord this she camel of god being a sign to you thereforelet her go at large to pasture on god s earth and touch her not to harm her lest a grievous chastisement seize you and remember how he hath made you successors to the adites and given youdwellings on the earth so that on its plains ye build castles and hew outhouses in the hills and bear in mind the benefits of god and lay not theearth waste with deeds of licence said the chiefs of his people puffed up with pride to those who wereesteemed weak even to those of them who believed what know ye for certainthat saleh is sent by his lord they said truly we believe in that withwhich he hath been sent then said those proud men verily we reject that in which ye believe and they ham strung the she camel and rebelled against their lord s command and said o saleh let thy menaces be accomplished upon us if thou art oneof the sent ones then the earthquake surprised them and in the morning they were found deadon their faces in their dwellings so he turned away from them and said o my people i did indeed announce toyou the message of my lord and i gave you faithful counsel but ye love notfaithful counsellors we also sent lot when he said to his people commit ye this filthy deed inwhich no creature hath gone before you come ye to men instead of women lustfully ye are indeed a people given upto excess but the only answer of his people was to say turn them out of your city for they are men who vaunt them pure and we delivered him and his family except his wife she was of those wholingered and we rained a rain upon them and see what was the end of the wicked and we sent to madian their brother shoaib he said o my people worshipgod ye have no other god than him now hath a clear sign come to you fromyour lord give therefore the full in measures and weights take from no manhis chattels and commit no disorder on the earth after it has been made sogood this will be better for you if you will believe it and lay not in ambush by every road in menacing sort nor mislead him whobelieveth in god from his way nor seek to make it crooked and rememberwhen ye were few and that he multiplied you and behold what hath been theend of the authors of disorder and if a part of you believe in that with which i am sent and a part of youbelieve not then wait steadfastly until god shall judge between us for heis the best of judges said the chiefs of his people puffed up with pride we will surely banishthee o shoaib and thy fellow believers from our cities unless indeed yeshall come back to our religion what said he though we abhor it now shall we have devised a lie concerning god if after he hath delivered usfrom your religion we shall return to it nor can we return to it unless bythe will of god our lord our lord embraceth all things in his ken in godhave we put our trust o our lord decide between us and between our people with truth for the best to decide art thou and the chiefs of his people who believed not said if ye follow shoaib yeshall then surely perish an earthquake therefore surprised them and they were found in the morningdead on their faces in their dwellings those who had treated shoaib as an impostor became as though they had neverdwelt in them they who treated shoaib as an impostor were they thatperished so he turned away from them and said o my people i proclaimed to you themessages of my lord and i counselled you aright but how should i be grievedfor a people who do not believe nor did we ever send a prophet to any city without afflicting its people withadversity and trouble that haply they might humble them then changed we their ill for good until they waxed wealthy and said ofold did troubles and blessings befall our fathers therefore did we seizeupon them suddenly when they were unaware but if that the people of these cities had believed and feared us we wouldsurely have laid open to them blessings out of the heaven and the earth butthey treated our signs as lies and we took vengeance on them for theirdeeds were the people therefore of those cities secure that our wrath would notlight on them by night while they were slumbering were the people of those cities secure that our wrath would not light on themin broad day while they were disporting themselves did they therefore deem themselves secure from the deep counsel of god but none deem themselves secure from the deep counsel of god save those whoperish is it not proved to those who inherit this land after its ancient occupants that if we please we can smite them for their sins and put a seal upon theirhearts that they hearken not we will tell thee the stories of these cities their apostles came to themwith clear proofs of their mission but they would not believe in what theyhad before treated as imposture thus doth god seal up the hearts of theunbelievers and we found not of their covenant in most of them but we found most of themto be perverse then after them we sent moses with our signs to pharaoh and his nobles whoacted unjustly in their regard but see what was the end of the corruptdoers and moses said o pharaoh verily i am an apostle from the lord of theworlds nothing but truth is it right for me to speak of god now am i come to youfrom your lord with a proof of my mission send away therefore the childrenof israel with me he said if thou comest with a sign shew it if thou arta man of truth so he threw down his rod and lo it distinctly became a serpent then drew he forth his hand and lo it was white to the beholders the nobles of pharaoh s people said verily this is an expert enchanter fain would he expel you from your land what then do ye order to be done they said put him and his brother off awhile and send round men to yourcities who shall musterand bring to thee every skilled enchanter and the enchanters came to pharaoh said they shall we surely be rewardedif we prevail he said yes and ye certainly shall be near my person they said o moses either cast thou down thy rod first or we will castdown ours he said cast ye down and when they had cast them down they enchanted thepeople s eyes and made them afraid for they had displayed a greatenchantment then spake we unto moses throw down thy rod and lo it devoured theirlying wonders so the truth was made strong and that which they had wrought proved vain and they were vanquished on the spot and drew back humiliated but the other enchanters prostrated themselves adoring said they we believe on the lord of the worlds the lord of moses and aaron said pharaoh have ye believed on him ere i have given you leave thistruly is a plot which ye have plotted in this my city in order to drive outits people but ye shall see in the end what shall happen i will surely cut off your hands and feet on opposite sides then will i haveyou all crucified they said verily to our lord do we return and thou takest vengeance on us only because we have believed on the signs ofour lord when they came to us lord pour out constancy upon us and cause usto die muslims then said the chiefs of pharaoh s people wilt thou let moses and his peoplego to spread disorders in our land and desert thee and thy gods he said we will cause their male children to be slain and preserve their femalesalive and verily we shall be masters over them said moses to his people cry unto god for help and bear up patiently forthe earth is god s to such of his servants as he pleaseth doth he give it asa heritage and for those that fear him is a happy issue we have been oppressed they said before thou camest to us and sincethou hast been with us perhaps said he your lord will destroy yourenemy and will make you his successors in the land and he will see how yewill act therein already had we chastised the people of pharaoh with dearth and scarcity offruits that haply they might take warning and when good fell to their lot they said this is our due but if illbefel them they regarded moses and his partisans as the birds of evilomen yet was not their evil omen from god but most of them knew it not and they said whatever sign thou bring us for our enchantment we will notbelieve on thee and we sent upon them the flood and the locusts and the kummal lice and thefrogs and the blood clear signs but they behaved proudly and were asinful people and when any plague fell upon them they said o moses pray for us to thylord according to that which he hath covenanted with thee truly if thoutake off the plague from us we will surely believe thee and will surelysend the children of israel with thee but when we had taken off the plaguefrom them and the time which god had granted them had expired behold they broke their promise therefore we took vengeance on them and drowned them in the sea because theytreated our signs as falsehoods and were heedless of them and we gave to the people who had been brought so low the eastern and thewestern lands which we had blessed as an heritage and the good word of thylord was fulfilled on the children of israel because they had borne up withpatience and we destroyed the works and the structures of pharaoh and hispeople and we brought the children of israel across the sea and they came to apeople who gave themselves up to their idols they said o moses make us agod as they have gods he said verily ye are an ignorant people for the worship they practise will be destroyed and that which they do isvain he said shall i seek any other god for you than god when it is he who hathpreferred you above all other peoples and remember when we rescued you from the people of pharaoh they had laid onyou a cruel affliction they slew your sons and let only your daughterslive and in this was a great trial from your lord and we appointed a meeting with moses for thirty nights which we completedwith ten other nights so that his whole time with his lord amounted toforty nights then said moses to his brother aaron take thou my place amongmy people and act rightly and follow not the way of the corrupt doers and when moses came at our set time and his lord spake with him he said olord shew thyself to me that i may look upon thee he said thou shaltnot see me but look towards the mount and if it abide firm in its place then shalt thou see me and when god manifested himself to the mountain heturned it to dust and moses fell in a swoon and when he came to himself he said glory be to thee to thee do i turn inpenitence and i am the first of them that believe he said o moses thee above all men have i chosen by my commissions and bymy speaking to thee take therefore what i have brought thee and be one ofthose who render thanks and we wrote for him upon the tables a monition concerning every matter andsaid receive them thyself with steadfastness and command thy people toreceive them for the observance of its most goodly precepts i will shew youthe abode of the wicked the unjustly proud ones of the earth will i turn aside from my signs foreven if they see every sign they will not believe them and if they see thepath of uprightness they will not take it for their path but if they seethe path of error for their path will they take it this for that they treated our signs as lies and were heedless of them vain will be the works of those who treated our signs and the meeting of thelife to come as lies shall they be rewarded but as they have wrought and the people of moses took during his absence a calf made of theirornaments and ruddy like gold and lowing saw they not that it could notspeak to them nor guide them in the way yet they took if for a god and became offenders but when they repented and saw that they had erred they said truly if ourlord have not mercy on us and forgive us we shall surely be of those whoperish and when moses returned to his people wrathful angered he said evil isit that ye have done next upon my departure would ye hasten on the judgmentsof your lord and he threw down the tables and seized his brother by thehead and dragged him unto him said he son of my mother the people thoughtme weak and had well nigh slain me make not mine enemies to rejoice overme and place me not among the wrong doers he said o lord forgive me and my brother and bring us into thy mercy forof those who shew mercy thou art the most merciful verily as to those who took the calf as a god wrath from their lord shallovertake them and shame in this present life for thus recompense we thedevisers of a lie but to those who have done evil then afterwards repent and believe thy lordwill thereafter be lenient merciful and when the anger of moses was stilled he took up the tables and in theirwriting was guidance and mercy for those who dread their lord and moses chose seventy men of his people for a meeting appointed by us andwhen the earthquake overtook them he said o my lord if it had been thypleasure thou hadst destroyed them and me ere this wilt thou destroy us forwhat our foolish ones have done it is nought but thy trial thou wiltmislead by it whom thou wilt and guide whom thou wilt our guardian thou forgive us then and have mercy on us for of those who forgive art thou thebest and write down for us what is good in this world as well as in the world tocome for to thee are we guided he said my chastisement shall fall onwhom i will and my mercy embraceth all things and i write it down for thosewho shall fear me and pay the alms and believe in our signs who shall follow the apostle the unlettered prophet whom they shall finddescribed with them in the law and evangel what is right will he enjointhem and forbid them what is wrong and will allow them healthful viands andprohibit the impure and will ease them of their burden and of the yokeswhich were upon them and those who shall believe in him and strengthen him and help him and follow the light which hath been sent down with him these are they with whom it shall be well say to them o men verily i am god s apostle to you all whose is the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth therefore believe ongod but he he maketh alive and killeth therefore believe on god and hisapostle the unlettered prophet who believeth in god and his word and followhim that ye may be guided aright and among the people of moses there is a certain number who guide otherswith truth and practise what is right according to it and we divided the israelites into twelve tribes as nations and we revealedunto moses when the people asked drink of him strike the rock with thystaff and there gushed forth from it twelve fountains the men all knewtheir drinking places and we caused clouds to overshadow them and sent downupon them the manna and the quails eat of the good things with whichwe have supplied you but it was not us whom they injured but they injuredtheir own selves and when it was said to them dwell in this city and eat therefrom what yewill and say hittat forgiveness and enter the gate with prostrations then will we pardon your offences we will give increase to the doers ofgood but the ungodly ones among them changed that word into another than thatwhich had been told them therefore sent we forth wrath out of heaven uponthem for their wrong doings and ask them about the city that stood by the sea when its inhabitantsbroke the sabbath when their fish came to them on their sabbath dayappearing openly but came not to them on the day when they kept no sabbath thus did we make trial of them for that they were evildoers and when some of them said why warn ye those whom god would destroy orchastise with terrible chastisement they said for our own excuse with yourlord and that they may fear him and when they forgot their warnings we delivered those who had forbiddenevil and we inflicted a severe chastisement on those who had done wrong forthat they were evil doers but when they proudly persisted in that which was forbidden we said to them become scouted apes and then thy lord declared that until the day of theresurrection he would surely send against them the jews those who shouldevil entreat and chastise them for prompt is thy lord to punish and he isforgiving merciful and we have divided them upon the earth as peoples some of them are uprightand some are otherwise and by good things and by evil things have we provedthem to the intent that they might return to us and they have had successors to succeed them they have inherited the book they have received the passing good things of this lower world and say it will be forgiven us yet if the like good things came to them again they would again receive them but hath there not been received on their parta covenant through the scripture that they should speak nought of god but thetruth and yet they study its contents but the mansion of the next worldhath more value for those who fear god do ye not then comprehend and who hold fast the book and observe prayer verily we will not sufferthe reward of the righteous to perish and when we shook the mount over them as if it had been a shadow and theythought it falling upon them receive said we with steadfastnesswhat we have brought you and remember what is therein to the end that ye mayfear god and when thy lord brought forth their descendants from the reins of the sonsof adam and took them to witness against themselves am i not said he your lord they said yes we witness it this we did lest ye should sayon the day of resurrection truly of this were we heedless becauseuninformed or lest ye should say our fathers indeed aforetime joined other gods withour god and we are their seed after them wilt thou destroy us for thedoings of vain men thus make we our signs clear that haply they may return to god recite to them the history of him to whom we vouchsafed our signs andwho departed from them so that satan followed him and he became one of theseduced had we pleased we had certainly thereby exalted him but he crouched to theearth and followed his own lust his likeness therefore is as that of thedog which lolls out his tongue whether thou chase him away or leave himalone such is the likeness of those who treat our signs as lies tell themthis tale then that they may consider evil the likeness of those who treat our signs as lies and it is themselvesthey injure he whom god guideth is the guided and they whom he misleadeth shall be thelost many moreover of the djinn and men have we created for hell hearts havethey with which they understand not and eyes have they with which they seenot and ears have they with which they hearken not they are like thebrutes yea they go more astray these are the heedless most excellent titles hath god by these call ye on him and stand alooffrom those who pervert his titles for what they have done shall they berepaid and among those whom we have created are a people who guide others withtruth and in accordance therewith act justly but as for those who treat our signs as lies we will gradually bring themdown by means of which they know not and though i lengthen their days verily my stratagem shall prove effectual will they not bethink them that their companion muhammad is not djinn possessed yes his office is only that of plain warner will they not look forth on the realms of the heaven and of the earth and onall things which god hath made to see whether haply their end be not drawingon and in what other book will they believe who reject the koran no other guide for him whom god shall mislead he will leave them distraughtin their wanderings they will ask thee of the hour for what time is its coming fixed say theknowledge of it is only with my lord none shall manifest it in its time buthe it is the burden of the heavens and of the earth not otherwise than ona sudden will it come on you they will ask thee as if thou wast privy to it say the knowledge of it iswith none but god but most men know not this say i have no control over what may be helpful or hurtful to me but as godwilleth had i the knowledge of his secrets i should revel in the good andevil should not touch me but i am only a warner and an announcer of goodtidings to those who believe he it is who hath created you from a single person and from him broughtforth his wife that he might dwell with her and when he had known her shebore a light burden and went about with it and when it became heavy theyboth cried to god their lord if thou give us a perfect child we will surelybe of the thankful yet when god had given them a perfect child they joined partners withhim in return for what he had given them but high is god above the partnersthey joined with him what will they join those with him who cannot create anything and arethemselves created and have no power to help them or to help themselves and if ye summon them to the guidance they will not follow you it is thesame to them whether ye summon them or whether ye hold your peace truly they whom ye call on beside god are like yourselves his servants call on them then and let them answer you if what ye say of them be true have they feet to walk with have they hands to hold with have they eyes tosee with have they ears to hear with say call on these joint gods ofyours then make your plot against me and delay it not verily my lord is god who hath sent down the book and he is theprotector of the righteous but they whom ye call on beside him can lend you no help nor can they helpthemselves and if ye summon them to the guidance they hear you not thou seest themlook towards thee but they do not see make the best of things and enjoin what is just and withdraw from theignorant and if stirrings to evil from satan stir thee fly thou for refuge to god heverily heareth knoweth verily they who fear god when some phantom from satan toucheth them remember him and lo they see clearly their brethren will only continue them in error and cannot preservethemselves from it and when thou bringest not a verse sign of the koran to them they say hast thou not yet patched it up say i only follow my lord s utterancesto me this is a clear proof on the part of your lord and a guidance and amercy for those who believe and when the koran is read then listen ye to it and keep silence that haplyye may obtain mercy and think within thine own self on god with lowliness and with fear andwithout loud spoken words at even and at morn and be not one of theheedless verily they who are round about thy lord

pain she bringeth him forth and his bearing andhis weaning is thirty months until when he attaineth his strength andattaineth to forty years he saith o my lord stir me up to be gratefulfor thy favours wherewith thou hast favoured me and my parents and to dogood works which shall please thee and prosper me in my offspring for tothee am i turned and am resigned to thy will am a muslim these are they from whom we will accept their best works and whose evilworks we will pass by among the inmates shall they be of paradise a truepromise which they are promised but he who saith to his parents fie on you both promise ye me that i shallbe taken forth from the grave alive when whole generations have alreadypassed away before me but they both will implore the help of god and say alas for thee believe for the promise of god is true but he saith itis no more than a fable of the ancients these are they in whom the sentence passed on the nations djinn and men whoflourished before them is made good they shall surely perish and there are grades for all according to their works that god may repaythem for their works and they shall not be dealt with unfairly and they who believe not shall one day be set before the fire ye made awayyour precious gifts during your life on earth and ye took your fill ofpleasure in them this day therefore with punishment of shame shall ye berewarded for that ye behaved you proudly and unjustly on the earth and forthat ye were given to excesses remember too the brother of ad when he warned his people in al ahkaf andbefore and since his time there have been warners worship none but god verily i fear for you the punishment of the great day they said art thou come to us to turn us away from our gods bring on usnow the woes which thou threatenest if thou speakest truth that knowledge said he is with god alone i only proclaim to you themessage with which i am sent but i perceive that ye are a people sunk inignorance so when they saw a cloud coming straight for their valleys they said it isa passing cloud that shall give us rain nay it is that whose speedycoming ye challenged a blast wherein is an afflictive punishment it will destroy everything at the bidding of its lord and at morn noughtwas to be seen but their empty dwellings thus repay we a wicked people with power had we endued them even as with power have we endued you and wehad given them ears and eyes and hearts yet neither their eyes nor theirears nor their hearts aided them at all when once they gainsaid the signsof god but that punishment which they had mocked at enveloped them on allsides of old too did we destroy the cities which were round about you and inorder that they might return to us we varied our signs before them but did those whom they took for gods beside god as his kindred deities helpthem nay they withdrew from them such was their delusion and theirdevice and remember when we turned aside a company of the djinn to thee that theymight hearken to the koran and no sooner were they present at its readingthan they said to each other hist and when it was ended they returned totheir people with warnings they said o our people verily we have been listening to a book sent downsince the days of moses affirming the previous scriptures it guideth to thetruth and to the right way o our people obey the summoner of god and believe in him that he mayforgive your sins and rescue you from an afflictive punishment and he who shall not respond to god s preacher yet cannot weaken god s poweron earth nor shall he have protectors beside him these are in obviouserror see they not that god who created the heavens and the earth and was notwearied with their creation is of power to quicken the dead yea he is forall things potent and a day is coming when the infidels shall be set before the fire is notthis it in truth they shall say aye by our lord he said taste thenthe punishment for that ye would not believe bear thou up then with patience as did the apostles endued with firmness and seek not to accelerate their doom for on the day when they shall seethat with which they have been menaced it shall be as though they had waited but an hour of the day enough shallany perish save they who transgress see sura lxviii p of a divine revelation authorising the worship of other gods than god abdallah bin salma say the commentators comp john vii

was probably invented after his accession to power lit suffer loss the prophet houd that is sandhills at taief to which muhammad had retired in consequenceof the opposition etc of the meccans verses are probably misplaced as they interrupt the connection between and but appear to belong tothe same period as the rest of the sura thus ullm als naheverwandte götter but wahl denen sie sich

hath created the heavens and the earth and ordainedthe darkness and the light yet unto their lord do the infidels give peers he it is who created you of clay then decreed the term of your life and withhim is another prefixed term for the resurrection yet have ye doubtsthereof and he is god in the heavens and on the earth he knoweth your secrets andyour disclosures and he knoweth what ye deserve never did one single sign from among the signs of their lord come to them but they turned away from it and now after it hath reached them have they treated the truth itself as alie but in the end a message as to that which they have mocked shall reachthem see they not how many generations we have destroyed before them we hadsettled them on the earth as we have not settled you and we sent down thevery heavens upon them in copious rains and we made the rivers to flowbeneath their feet yet we destroyed them in their sins and raised up othergenerations to succeed them and had we sent down to thee a book written on parchment and they hadtouched it with their hands the infidels had surely said this is noughtbut plain sorcery they say too unless an angel be sent down to him but if we hadsent down an angel their judgment would have come on them at once and theywould have had no respite and if we had appointed an angel we should certainly have appointed one inthe form of a man and we should have clothed him before them in garmentslike their own moreover apostles before thee have been laughed to scorn but that whichthey laughed to scorn encompassed the mockers among them say go through the land then see what hath been the end of those whotreated them as liars say whose is all that is in the heavens and the earth say god s he had imposed mercy on himself as a law he will surely assembleyou on the resurrection day there is no doubt of it they who are theauthors of their own ruin are they who will not believe his whatsoever hath its dwelling in the night and in the day and he thehearing the knowing say other than god shall i take as lord maker of the heavens and of theearth who nourisheth all and of none is nourished say verily i am biddento be the first of those who surrender them to god profess islam and benot thou of those who join gods with god say verily i fear should i rebel against my lord the punishment of thegreat day from whomsoever it shall be averted on that day he will have had mercy onhim and this will be the manifest bliss if god touch thee with trouble none can take it off but he and if he visitthee with good it is he whose power is over all things and he is the supreme over his servants and he is the wise the cognisant say what thing is weightiest in bearing witness say god is witness betweenme and you and this koran hath been revealed to me that i should warn you byit and all whom it shall reach what will ye really bear witness that thereare other gods with god say i bear no such witness say verily he is onegod and truly am guiltless of what ye join with him they to whom we have given the book recognise him muhammad as they dotheir own children but they who are the authors of their own perdition arethey who will not believe and who more wicked than he who inventeth a lie concerning god or whotreateth our signs as lies verily those wicked ones shall not prosper and on the day we will gather them all together then will we say to thosewho joined gods with god where are those companion gods of yours as yesupposed them then shall they find no other excuse than to say by god our lord we joinednot companions with him behold how they lie against themselves and the gods of their own inventingdesert them some among them hearken unto thee but we have cast veils over their heartsthat they should not understand the koran and a weight into their ears andthough they should see all kinds of signs they will refuse all faith inthem until when they come to thee to dispute with thee the infidels say verily this is nothing but fables of the ancients and they will forbid it and depart from it but they are only the authors oftheir own perdition and know it not if thou couldst see when they shall be set over the fire and shall say oh would we might be sent back we would not treat the signs of our lord aslies we would be of the believers aye that hath become clear to them which they before concealed but thoughthey should return they would surely go back to that which was forbiddenthem for they are surely liars and they say there is no other than our life in this world neither shallwe be raised again but if thou couldest see when they shall be set before their lord he shallsay to them is not this it in truth they shall say yea by our lord taste then saith he the torment for that ye believed not lost are they who deny the meeting with god until the hour cometh suddenlyupon them then will they say oh our sighs for past negligence of thishour and they shall bear their burdens on their back will not that be evilwith which they shall be burdened the life in this world is but a play and pastime and better surely for menof godly fear will be the future mansion will ye not then comprehend now know we that what they speak vexeth thee but it is not merely thee whomthey charge with falsehood but the ungodly gainsay the signs of god before thee have apostles already been charged with falsehood but they borethe charge and the wrong with constancy till our help came to them for nonecan change the words of god but this history of his sent ones hath alreadyreached thee but if their estrangement be grievous to thee and if thou art able to seekout an opening into the earth or a ladder into heaven that thou mightestbring them a sign yes but if god pleased he would surely bringthem one and all to the guidance therefore be not thou one of theignorant to those only who shall lend an ear will he make answer as for the dead godwill raise them up then unto him shall they return they say unless a sign be sent down to him from his lord say verily god is able to send down a sign but the greater part of them know itnot no kind of beast is there on earth nor fowl that flieth with its wings butis a folk like you nothing have we passed over in the book then untotheir lord shall they be gathered they who gainsay our signs are deaf and dumb in darkness god will misleadwhom he pleaseth and whom he pleaseth he will place upon the straight path say what think ye if the punishment of god were to come upon you or thehour were to come upon you will ye cry to any other than god tell me ifye speak the truth yes to him will ye cry and if he please he will deliver you from that yeshall cry to him to avert and ye shall forget the partners ye joined withhim already have we sent apostles to nations that were before thee and we laidhold on them with troubles and with straits in order that they might humblethemselves yet when our trouble came upon them they did not humble themselves buttheir hearts were hardened and satan pre arranged for them their course ofconduct and when they had forgotten their warnings we set open to them the gates ofall things until as they were rejoicing in our gifts we suddenly laid holdupon them and lo they were plunged into despair and the uttermost part of that impious people was cut off all praise be togod the lord of the worlds say what think ye if god should take away your hearing and your sight andset a seal upon your hearts what god beside god would restore them to you see how we vary our wondrous verses signs yet they turn away from them say what think ye if the punishment of god come on you suddenly orforeseen shall any perish except the impious we send not our sent ones but as heralds of good news and warners and whososhall believe and amend on them shall come no fear neither shall they besorrowful but whoso shall charge our signs with falsehood on them shall fall apunishment for their wicked doings say i say not to you in my possession are the treasures of god neithersay i i know things secret neither do i say to you verily i am anangel only what is revealed to me do i follow say shall the blind and theseeing be esteemed alike will ye not then reflect and warn those who dread their being gathered to their lord that patron orintercessor they shall have none but him to the intent that they may fearhim and thrust not thou away those who cry to their lord at morn and even craving to behold his face it is not for thee in anything to judge of theirmotives nor for them in anything to judge of thee if thou thrust them awaythou wilt be of the doers of wrong thus have we made proof of some of them by others that they may say arethese they among us to whom god hath been gracious doth not god best knowthe thankful and when they who believe in our signs come to thee say peace be upon you your lord hath laid down for himself a law of mercy so that if any one ofyou commit a fault through ignorance and afterwards turn and amend hesurely will be gracious merciful thus have we distinctly set forth our signs that the way of the wicked mightbe made known say forbidden am i to worship those whom ye call on beside god say i willnot follow your wishes for then should i have gone astray and should not beof the guided say i act upon proofs from my lord but ye treat them as falsehoods thatpunishment which ye desire to be hastened is not in my power judgment iswith god only he will declare the truth and he is the best settler ofdisputes say if what ye would hasten on were in my power the matter between me andyou had been decided but god best knoweth the impious and with him are the keys of the secret things none knoweth them but he he knoweth whatever is on the land and in the sea and no leaf falleth but heknoweth it neither is there a grain in the darknesses of the earth nor athing green or sere but it is noted in a distinct writing it is he who taketh your souls at night and knoweth what ye have meritedin the day then he awaketh you therein that the set life term may befulfilled then unto him shall ye return and then shall be declare to youthat which ye have wrought supreme over his servants he sendeth forth guardians who watch over you until when death overtaketh any one of you our messengers take his soul and fail not then are they returned to god their lord the true is not judgment his swiftest he of those who take account say who rescueth you from the darkness of the land and of the sea whenhumbly and secretly ye cry to him if thou rescue us from this we willsurely be of the thankful say god rescueth you from them and from every strait yet afterwards yegive him companions say it is he who hath power to send on you a punishment from above you orfrom beneath your feet or to clothe you with discord and to make some ofyou to taste the violence of others see how variously we handle the wondrousverses that haply they may become wise but thy people hath accused the koran of falsehood though it be the truth say i am not in charge of you to every prophecy is its set time and bye and bye ye shall know it and when thou seest those who busy themselves with cavilling at our signs withdraw from them till they busy themselves in some other subject and ifsatan cause thee to forget this sit not after recollection with theungodly people not that they who fear god are to pass any judgment upon them but the objectof recollection is that they may continue to fear him and quit those who make their religion a sport and a pastime and whom thispresent life hath deceived warn them hereby that every soul will beconsigned to doom for its own works patron or intercessor beside god shallit have none and could it compensate with fullest compensation it would notbe accepted from it they who for their deeds shall be consigned to doom forthem are draughts of boiling water and a grievous torment for that theybelieved not say shall we beside god call upon those who can neither help nor hurt us shall we turn upon our heel after that god hath guided us like somebewildered man whom the satans have spell bound in the desert though hiscompanions call him to the true guidance with come to us say verily guidance from god that is the true guidance and we are commanded tosurrender ourselves to the lord of the worlds and observe ye the times of prayer and fear ye god for it is he to whom yeshall be gathered and it is he who hath created the heavens and the earth in truth and whenhe saith to a thing be it is his word is the truth and his the kingdom on the day when there shall be ablast on the trumpet he knoweth alike the unseen and the seen and he is thewise the cognisant and remember when abraham said to his father azar takest thou images asgods verily i see that thou and thy people are in manifest error and thus did we shew abraham the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth that he might be stablished in knowledge and when the night overshadowed him he beheld a star this said he ismy lord but when it set he said i love not gods which set and when he beheld the moon uprising this said he is my lord but whenit set he said surely if my lord guide me not i shall surely be of thosewho go astray and when he beheld the sun uprise he said this is my lord this isgreatest but when it set he said o my people i share not with you theguilt of joining gods with god i turn my face to him who hath created the heavens and the earth followingthe right religion i am not one of those who add gods to god and his people disputed with him he said dispute ye with me about god when he hath guided me and i fear not the deities whom ye join with him foronly by the will of my lord have they any power my lord embraceth allthings in his knowledge will ye not then consider and how should i fear what ye have joined with god since ye fear not forhaving joined with him that for which he hath sent you down no warranty which therefore of the two parties is more worthy of safety know ye that they who believe and who clothe not their faith with error theirs issafety and they are guided aright this is our reasoning with which we furnished abraham against his people weuplift to grades of wisdom whom we will verily thy lord is wise knowing and we gave him isaac and jacob and guided both aright and we had beforeguided noah and among the descendants of abraham david and solomon and joband joseph and moses and aaron thus do we recompense the righteous and zachariah john jesus and elias all were just persons and ismael and elisha and jonas and lot all these have we favoured abovemankind and some of their fathers and of their offspring and of their brethren andwe chose them and guided them into the straight way this is god s guidance he guideth by it such of his servants as he will butif they join others god with him vain assuredly shall be all their works these are they to whom we gave the scripture and wisdom and prophecy but ifthese their posterity believe not therein we will entrust these gifts to apeople who will not disbelieve therein these are they whom god hath guided follow therefore their guidance say nopay do i ask of you for this verily it is no other than the teaching forall creatures no just estimate do they form of god when they say nothing hath god sentdown to man say who sent down the book which moses brought a light andguidance to man which ye set down on paper publishing part but concealingmost though ye have now been taught that which neither ye nor your fathersknew say it is god then leave them in their pastime of cavillings and this book which we have sent down is blessed confirming that which wasbefore it and in order that thou mightest warn the mother city and those whodwell round about it they who believe in the next life will believe in it and will keep strictly to their prayers but is any more wicked than he who deviseth a lie of god or saith i havehad a revelation when nothing was revealed to him and who saith i canbring down a book like that which god hath sent down but couldst thou seewhen the ungodly are in the floods of death and the angels reach forth theirhands saying yield up your souls this day shall ye be recompensed with ahumiliating punishment for your untrue sayings about god and for proudlyrejecting his signs and now are ye come back to us alone as we created you at first and yeleave behind you the good things which we had given you and we see not withyou your intercessors whom ye regarded as the companions of god among you there is a severance between you now and those whom ye regarded as partnerswith god have deserted you verily god causeth the grain and the date stone to put forth he bringethforth the living from the dead and the dead from the living this is god why then are ye turned aside from him he causeth the dawn to appear and hath ordained the night for rest and thesun and the moon for computing time the ordinance of the mighty the wise and it is he who hath ordained the stars for you that ye may be guidedthereby in the darknesses of the land and of the sea clear have we made oursigns to men of knowledge and it is he who hath produced you from one man and hath provided for you anabode and resting place clear have we made our signs for men of insight and it is he who sendeth down rain from heaven and we bring forth by it thebuds of all the plants and from them bring we forth the green foliage andthe close growing grain and palm trees with sheaths of clustering dates andgardens of grapes and the olive and the pomegranate like and unlike lookye on their fruits when they fruit and ripen truly herein are signs untopeople who believe yet have they assigned the djinn to god as his associates though he createdthem and in their ignorance have they falsely ascribed to him sons anddaughters glory be to him and high let him be exalted above that which theyattribute to him sole maker of the heavens and of the earth how when he hath no consort should he have a son he hath created everything and he knoweth everything this is god your lord there is no god but he the creator of all things therefore worship him alone and he watcheth over all things no vision taketh in him but he taketh in all vision and he is thesubtile the all informed now have proofs that may be seen come to you from your lord whoso seeththem the advantage will be his own and whoso is blind to them his own willbe the loss i am not made a keeper over you thus variously do we apply our signs that they may say thou hast studieddeep and that to people of understanding we may make them clear follow thou that which hath been revealed to thee by thy lord there is nogod but he and withdraw from those who join other gods with him had god pleased they had not joined other gods with him and we have notmade thee keeper over them neither art thou a guardian over them revile not those whom they call on beside god lest they in theirignorance despitefully revile him thus have we planned out their actionsfor every people then shall they return to their lord and he will declareto them what those actions have been with their most solemn oath have they sworn by god that if a sign come untothem they will certainly believe it say signs are in the power of godalone and he teacheth you not thereby only because when they were wrought ye did not believe and we will turn their hearts and their eyes away from the truth becausethey did not believe therein at first and we will leave them in theirtransgressions wandering in perplexity and though we had sent down the angels to them and the dead had spoken tothem and we had gathered all things about them in tribes they had notbelieved unless god had willed it but most of them do not know it thus have we given an enemy to every prophet satans among men and amongdjinn tinsel discourses do they suggest the one to the other in order todeceive and had thy lord willed it they would not have done it therefore leave them and their vain imaginings and let the hearts of those who believe not in the life to come inclinethereto and let them find their content in this and let them gain what theyare gaining what shall i seek other judge than god when it is he who hath sent down toyou the distinguishing book they to whom we have given the book know that itis sent down from thy lord with truth be not thou then of those who doubt and the words of thy lord are perfect in truth and in justice none canchange his words he is the hearing knowing but if thou obey most men in this land from the path of god will theymislead thee they follow but a conceit and they are only liars thy lord he best knoweth those who err from his path and he knoweth therightly guided eat of that over which the name of god hath been pronounced if ye believein his signs and why eat ye not of that over which the name of god hath been pronounced since he hath made plain to you what he hath forbidden you save as to thatwhich is forced upon you but indeed many mislead others by their appetites through lack of knowledge verily thy lord he best knoweth thetransgressors and abandon the semblance of wickedness and wickedness itself they verily whose only acquirement is iniquity shall be rewarded for what theyshall have gained eat not therefore of that on which the name of god has not been named forthat is assuredly a crime the satans will indeed suggest to their votariesto wrangle with you but if ye obey them ye will indeed be of those who joingods with god shall the dead whom we have quickened and for whom we have ordained a lightwhereby he may walk among men be like him whose likeness is in thedarkness whence he will not come forth thus have the doings of theunbelievers been prepared for them even so have we placed in every city ringleaders of its wicked ones toscheme therein but only against themselves shall they scheme and they knowit not and when a sign cometh to them they say we will not believe till the likeof what was accorded to the apostles of god be accorded to us god bestknoweth where to place his mission disgrace with god and a vehementpunishment shall come on the transgressors for their crafty plottings and whom god shall please to guide that man s breast will he open to islam but whom he shall please to mislead strait and narrow will he make hisbreast as though he were mounting up into the very heavens thus doth godinflict dire punishment on those who believe not and this is the right way of thy lord now have we detailed our signs untothose who will consider for them is a dwelling of peace with their lord and in recompense for theirworks shall he be their protector on the day whereon god shall gather them all together o race ofdjinn will he say much did ye exact from mankind and their votariesfrom among men shall say o our lord we rendered one another mutualservices but we have reached our set term which thou hast set for us hewill say your abode the fire therein abide ye for ever unless as godshall will verily thy lord is wise knowing even thus place we some of the wicked over others as the meed of theirdoings o race of djinn and men came not apostles to you from among yourselves rehearsing my signs to you and warning you of the meeting of this your day they shall say we bear witness against ourselves this world s lifedeceived them and they shall bear witness against themselves that they wereinfidels this because thy lord would not destroy the cities in their sin whiletheir people were yet careless and for all are grades of recompense as the result of their deeds and ofwhat they do thy lord is not regardless and thy lord is the rich one full of compassion he can destroy you if heplease and cause whom he will to succeed you as he raised you up from theoffspring of other people verily that which is threatened you shall surely come to pass neither shallye weaken its might say o my people act as ye best can i verily will act my part andhereafter shall ye knowwhose will be the recompense of the abode verily the ungodly shall notprosper moreover they set apart a portion of the fruits and cattle which he hathproduced and say this for god so deem they and this for his companions whom we associate with him but that which is for these companions oftheirs cometh not to god yet that which is for god cometh to thecompanions ill do they judge thus have the companion gods induced many of these who join them with god to slay their children that they might ruin them and throw the cloak ofconfusion over their religion but if god had pleased they had not donethis therefore leave them and their devices they also say these cattle and fruits are sacred none may taste them butwhom we please so deem they and there are cattle whose backs should beexempt from labour and there are cattle over which they do not pronouncethe name of god inventing in all this a lie against him for theirinventions shall he reward them and they say that which is in the wombs of these cattle is allowed to ourmales and forbidden to our wives but if it prove abortive both partake ofit god shall reward them for their distinctions knowing wise is he lost are they who in their ignorance have foolishly slain their children and have forbidden that which god hath given them for food devising anuntruth against god now have they erred and they were not rightly guided he it is who produceth gardens of the vine trellised and untrellised and thepalm trees and the corn of various food and olives and pomegranates likeand unlike eat of their fruit when they bear fruit and pay the due thereofon the day of its ingathering and be not prodigal for god loveth not theprodigal and there are cattle for burdens and for journeys eat of what god hath givenyou for food and follow not the steps of satan for he is your declaredenemy you have four sorts of cattle in pairs of sheep a pair and of goats a pair say hath he forbidden the two males or the two females or that which thewombs of the two females enclose tell me with knowledge if ye speak thetruth and of camels a pair and of oxen a pair say hath he forbidden the twomales or the two females or that which the wombs of the two femalesenclose were ye witnesses when god enjoined you this who then is morewicked than he who in his ignorance inventeth a lie against god to misleadmen god truly guideth not the wicked say i find not in what hath been revealed to me aught forbidden to the eaterto eat except it be that which dieth of itself or blood poured forth orswine s flesh for this is unclean or profane being slain in the name ofother than god but whoso shall be a forced partaker if it be withoutwilfulness and not in transgression verily thy lord is indulgent merciful to the jews did we forbid every beast having an entire hoof and of bothbullocks and sheep we forbade them the fat save what might be on theirbacks or their entrails and the fat attached to the bone with this have werecompensed them because of their transgression and verily we are indeedequitable if they treat thee as an impostor then say your lord is of all embracingmercy but his severity shall not be turned aside from the wicked they who add gods to god will say if god had pleased neither we nor ourfathers had given him companions nor should we have interdicted anything thus did they who flourished before them charge with imposture until theyhad tasted our severity say have ye any knowledge that ye can produce tous verily ye follow only a conceit ye utter only lies say peremptory proof is god s had he pleased he had guided you all aright say bring hither your witnesses who can witness that god hath forbiddenthese animals but if they bear witness witness not thou with them norwitness to the conceits of those who charge our signs with falsehood and whobelieve not in the life to come and give equals to our lord say come i will rehearse what your lord hath made binding on you that yeassign not aught to him as partner and that ye be good to your parents andthat ye slay not your children because of poverty for them and for you willwe provide and that ye come not near to pollutions outward or inward and that ye slay not anyone whom god hath forbidden you unless for a justcause this hath he enjoined on you to the intent that ye may understand and come not nigh to the substance of the orphan but to improve it until hecome of age and use a full measure and a just balance we will not task asoul beyond its ability and when ye give judgment observe justice eventhough it be the affair of a kinsman and fulfil the covenant of god thishath god enjoined you for your monition and this is my right way follow it then and follow not other paths lestye be scattered from his path this hath he enjoined you that ye may fearhim then gave we the book to moses complete for him who should do right and adecision for all matters and a guidance and a mercy that they mightbelieve in the meeting with their lord blessed too this book which we have sent down wherefore follow it and feargod that ye may find mercy lest ye should say the scriptures were indeed sent down only unto twopeoples before us but we were not able to go deep into their studies or lest ye should say if a book had been sent down to us we had surelyfollowed the guidance better than they but now hath a clear exposition cometo you from your lord and a guidance and a mercy who then is more wickedthan he who treateth the signs of god as lies and turneth aside from them we will recompense those who turn aside from our signs with an evilpunishment because they have turned aside what wait they for but the coming of the angels to them or the coming ofthy lord himself or that some of the sings of the lord should come to pass on the day when some of thy lord s signs shall come to pass its faith shallnot profit a soul which believed not before nor wrought good works in virtueof its faith say wait ye verily we will wait also as to those who split up their religion and become sects have thou nothingto do with them their affair is with god only hereafter shall he tell themwhat they have done he who shall present himself with good works shall receive a tenfold reward but he who shall present himself with evil works shall receive none otherthan a like punishment and they shall not be treated unjustly say as for me my lord hath guided me into a straight path a true religion the creed of abraham the sound in faith for he was not of those who joingods with god say my prayers and my worship and my life and my death are unto god lord ofthe worlds he hath no associate this am i commanded and i am the first ofthe muslims say shall i seek any other lord than god when he is lord of all things nosoul shall labour but for itself and no burdened one shall bear another sburden at last ye shall return to your lord and he will declare that to youabout which you differ and it is he who hath made you the successors of others on the earth andhath raised some of you above others by various grades that he may prove youby his gifts verily thy lord is swift to punish but he is also gracious merciful lit their affair would have been decided in that case there would nolonger have been an opportunity for the warnings of the prophets and forrepentance but the angels would at once have executed the divine judgments see sura xli p see sura xc xiii this denunciation is repeated in eleven other passages of the koran andcoupled with the known reverence of the early muslims for what theyconsidered as the word of god must have greatly tended to secure therevelations of the prophet from being in any way tampered with and corrupted they are self convicted of

throne and imposed laws on the sun and moon each travelleth toits appointed goal he ordereth all things he maketh his signs clear thatye may have firm faith in a meeting with your lord and he it is who hath outstretched the earth and placed on it the firmmountains and rivers and of every fruit he hath placed on it two kinds hecauseth the night to enshroud the day verily in this are signs for those whoreflect and on the earth hard by each other are its various portions gardens ofgrapes and corn and palm trees single or clustered though watered by thesame water yet some make we more excellent as food than other verily in allthis are signs for those who understand if ever thou dost marvel marvellous surely is their saying what when wehave become dust shall we be restored in a new creation these are they who in their lord believe not these the collars shall be ontheir necks and these shall be inmates of the fire to abide therein foraye to hasten evil rather than good will they challenge thee but before theirtime have been like examples full truly of mercy is thy lord unto men despite their sins but verily thy lord is right vehement to punish and they who believe not say if a sign from his lord be not sent down tohim thou art a warner only and every people hath its guide god knoweth the burden of every female and how much their wombs lessen andenlarge with him everything

and he who cometh forthin the day each hath a succession of angels before him and behind him who watch overhim by god s behest verily god will not change his gifts to men till theychange what is in themselves and when god willeth evil unto men there isnone can turn it away nor have they any protector beside him he it is who maketh the lightning to shine unto you for fear and hope andwho bringeth up the laden clouds and the thunder uttereth his praise and the angels also for awe of him andhe sendeth his bolts and smiteth with them whom he will while they arewrangling about god mighty is he in

when it cannot reach it theprayer of the infidels only wandereth and is lost and unto god doth all in the heavens and on the earth bow down in worship willingly or by constraint their very shadows

from the metalswhich are molten in the fire for the sake of ornaments or utensils a likescum ariseth in this way doth god depict set forth truth and falsehood asto the foam it is quickly gone and as to what is useful to man itremaineth on the earth thus doth god set forth comparisons to those whorespond to their lord shall be an excellent reward but those who respond notto his call had they all that the earth containeth twice over they wouldsurely give it for their ransom evil their reckoning and hell their home and wretched the bed shall he then who knoweth that what hath been sent down to thee from thy lordis the truth act like him who is blind men of insight only will bear thisin mind who fulfil their pledge to god and break not their compact and who join together what god hath bidden to be joined and who fear theirlord and dread an ill reckoning and who from desire to see the face of their lord are constant amid trials and observe prayer and give alms in secret and openly out of what we havebestowed upon them and turn aside evil by good for these is the recompenseof that abode gardens of eden into which they shall enter together with the just of theirfathers and their wives and their descendants and the angels shall go inunto them at every portal peace be with you say they because ye have endured all things charmingthe recompense of their abode but those who after having contracted it break their covenant with god andcut asunder what god hath bidden to be united and commit misdeeds on theearth these a curse awaiteth them and an ill abode god is open handed with supplies to whom he will or is sparing they rejoicein the life that now is but this present life is but a passing good inrespect of the life to come and they who believe not say unless a sign be sent down to him from hislord say god truly will mislead whom he will and he will guide tohimself him who turneth to him those who believe and whose hearts rest securely on the thought of god what shall not men s hearts repose in the thought of god they who believeand do the things that be right blessedness awaiteth them and a goodly home thus have we sent thee to a people whom other peoples have preceded thatthou mightest rehearse to them our revelations to thee yet they believe noton the god of mercy say he is my lord there is no god but he in him do iput my trust to him must i return if there were a koran by which the mountains could be set in motion or theearth cleft or the dead be made to speak but all sovereignty is in thehands of god do then believers doubt that had he pleased god wouldcertainly have guided all men aright misfortune shall not cease to light on the unbelievers for what they havedone or to take up its abode hard by their dwellings until the threat ofgod come to pass verily god will not fail his plighted word before thee indeed have apostles been mocked at but though i bore long withthe unbelievers at last i seized upon them and how severe was mypunishment who is it then that is standing over every soul to mark its actions yet havethey set up associates with god say name them what would ye inform god ofthat which he knoweth not on the earth or are they not a mere empty name but prepared of old for the infidels was this fraud of theirs and they areturned aside from the path and whom god causeth to err no guide shall therebe for him chastisement awaiteth them in this present life and more grievous shall bethe chastisement of the next and none shall screen them from god a picture of the paradise which god hath promised to them that fear him

in what hath been sent down tothee yet some are banded together who deny a part of it say i am commandedto worship god and not to associate any creature with him on him do i call and to him shall i return thus then as a code in the arabic tongue have we sent down the koran andtruly if after the knowledge that hath reached thee thou follow theirdesires thou shalt have no guardian nor protector against god apostles truly have we already sent before thee and wives and offspring havewe given them yet no apostle had come with miracles unless by the leave ofgod to each age its book what he

believe in what hath been sent down to thee and in what hath beensent down before thee and full faith have they in the life to come these are guided by their lord and with these it shall be well as to the infidels alike is it to them whether thou warn them or warn themnot they will not believe their hearts and their ears hath god sealed up and over their eyes is acovering for them a severe chastisement and some there are who say we believe in god and in the latter day yetare they not believers fain would they deceive god and those who have believed but they deceivethemselves only and know it not diseased are their hearts and that disease hath god increased creased tothem their s a sore chastisement for that they treated their prophet as aliar and when it is said to them cause not disorders in the earth they say nay rather do we set them right is it not that they are themselves the authors of disorder but they perceiveit not and when it is said to them believe as other men have believed they say shall we believe as the fools have believed is it not that they arethemselves the fools but they know it not and when they meet the faithful they say we believe but when they areapart with their satans they say verily we hold with you and at them weonly mock god shall mock at them and keep them long in their rebellion wandering inperplexity these are they who have purchased error at the price of guidance but theirtraffic hath not been gainful neither are they guided at all they are like one who kindleth a fire and when it hath thrown its light onall around him god taketh away their light and leaveth them indarkness they cannot see deaf dumb blind therefore they shall not retrace their steps from error or like those who when there cometh a storm cloud out of the heaven bigwith darkness thunder and lightning thrust their fingers into their earsbecause of the thunder clap for fear of death god is round about theinfidels the lightning almost snatcheth away their eyes so oft as it gleameth on themthey walk on in it but when darkness closeth upon them they stop and ifgod pleased of their ears and of their eyes would he surely deprive them verily god is almighty o men of mecca adore your lord who hath created youand those who were before you haply ye will fear himwho hath made the earth a bed for you and the heaven a covering and hathcaused water to come down from heaven and by it hath brought forth fruitsfor your sustenance do not then wittingly give peers to god and if ye be in doubt as to that which we have sent down to our servant thenproduce a sura like it and summon your witnesses beside god if ye are menof truth but if ye do it not and never shall ye do it then fear the fire preparedfor the infidels whose fuel is men and stones but announce to those who believe and do the things that are right that forthem are gardens neath which the rivers flow so oft as they are fedtherefrom with fruit for sustenance they shall say this same was oursustenance of old and they shall have its like given to them thereinshall they have wives of perfect purity and therein shall they abide forever verily god is not ashamed to set forth as well the instance of a gnat as ofany nobler object for as to those who have believed they know it to be thetruth from their lord but as to the unbelievers they will say whatmeaneth god by this comparison many will he mislead by such parables andmany guide but none will he mislead thereby except the wicked who after its establishment violate the covenant of god and cut insunder what god hath bidden to be joined and act disorderly on the earth these are they who shall suffer loss how can ye withhold faith from god ye were dead and he gave you life nexthe will cause you to die next he will restore you to life next shall yereturn to him he it is who created for you all that is on earth then proceeded to theheaven and into seven heavens did he fashion it and he knoweth allthings when thy lord said to the angels verily i am about to place one in mystead on earth they said wilt thou place there one who will do illtherein and shed blood when we celebrate thy praise and extol thy holiness god said verily i know what ye know not and he taught adam the names of all things and then set them before theangels and said tell me the names of these if ye are endued withwisdom they said praise be to thee we have no knowledge but what thou hast givenus to know thou thou art the knowing the wise he said o adam inform them of their names and when he had informed themof their names he said did i not say to you that i know the hidden thingsof the heavens and of the earth and that i know what ye bring to light andwhat ye hide and when we said to the angels bow down and worship adam then worshippedthey all save eblis he refused and swelled with pride and became one ofthe unbelievers and we said o adam dwell thou and thy wife in the garden and eat yeplentifully therefrom wherever ye list but to this tree come not nigh lestye become of the transgressors but satan made them slip from it and caused their banishment from theplace in which they were and we said get ye down the one of you an enemyto the other and there shall be for you in the earth a dwelling place and aprovision for a time and words of prayer learned adam from his lord and god turned to him for heloveth to turn the merciful we said get ye down from it all together and ifguidance shall come to you from me whoso shall follow my guidance on themshall come no fear neither shall they be grieved but they who shall not believe and treat our signs as false hoods theseshall be inmates of the fire in it shall they remain for ever o children of israel remember my favour wherewith i shewed favour upon you and be true to your covenant with me i will be true to my covenant with you me therefore revere me and believe in what i have sent down confirming yourscriptures and be not the first to disbelieve it neither for a mean pricebarter my signs me therefore fear ye me and clothe not the truth with falsehood and hide not the truth when ye knowit and observe prayer and pay the legal impost and bow down with those who bow will ye enjoin what is right upon others and forget yourselves yet ye readthe book will ye not understand and seek help with patience and prayer a hard duty indeed is this but notto the humble who bear in mind that they shall meet their lord and that unto him shallthey return o children of israel remember my favour wherewith i shewed favour upon you for verily to you above all human beings have i been bounteous and fear ye the day when soul shall not satisfy for soul at all nor shallany intercession be accepted from them nor shall any ransom be taken neither shall they be helped and remember when we rescued you from the people of pharaoh who had laid onyou a cruel chastisement they slew your male children and let only yourfemales live and in this was a great trial from your lord and when we parted the sea for you and saved you and drowned the people ofpharaoh while ye were looking on and when we were in treaty with moses forty nights then during his absencetook ye the calf and acted wickedly yet after this we forgave you that ye might be grateful and when we gave moses the book and the illumination in order to yourguidance and remember when moses said to his people o my people verily ye havesinned to your own hurt by your taking the calf to worship it be turnedthen to your creator and slay the guilty among you this will be best foryou with your creator then turned he unto you for he is the one whoturneth the merciful and when ye said o moses we will not believe thee until we see godplainly the thunderbolt fell upon you while ye were looking on then we raised you to life after ye had been dead that haply ye might givethanks and we caused the clouds to overshadow you and we sent down manna and quailsupon you eat of the good things we have give you for sustenance and theyinjured not us but they injured themselves and when we said enter this city and eat therefrom plentifully at yourwill and enter the gate with prostrations and say forgiveness and wewill pardon you your sins and give an increase to the doers of good but the evil doers changed that word into another than that spoken to them and we sent down upon those evil doers wrath from heaven for that they haddone amiss and when moses asked drink for his people we said strike the rock with thyrod and from it there gushed twelve fountains each tribe knew theirdrinking place eat and drink said we of what god hath supplied and dono wrong on the earth by licentious deeds and when ye said o moses we will not put up with one sort of food pray therefore thy lord for us that he would bring forth for us of that whichthe earth groweth its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentilsand its onions he said what will ye exchange that which is worse forwhat is better get ye down into egypt for ye shall have what ye haveasked vileness and poverty were stamped upon them and they returned withwrath from god this for that they disbelieved the signs of god and slewthe prophets unjustly this for that they rebelled and transgressed verily they who believe muslims and they who follow the jewish religion and the christians and the sabeites whoever of these believeth in god andthe last day and doeth that which is right shall have their reward withtheir lord fear shall not come upon them neither shall they be grieved call to mind also when we entered into a covenant with you and lifted up themountain over you take hold said we on what we have revealed to you with resolution and remember what is therein that ye may fear but after this ye turned back and but for god s grace and mercy toward you ye had surely been of the lost ye know too those of you who transgressed onthe sabbath and to whom we said be changed into scouted apes and we made them a warning to those of their day and to those who came afterthem and a caution to the god fearing and when moses said to his people verily god bids you sacrifice a cow they said makest thou a jest of us he said god keep me from being oneof the foolish they said call on thy lord for us that he would make plainto us what she is he said god saith she is a cow neither old nor young but of the middle age between the two do therefore what ye are bidden they said call on your lord for us that he would make plain to us what isher colour he said god saith she is a fawn coloured cow her colour isvery bright she rejoiceth the beholders they said call on they lord for us that he would make plain to us what cowit is for to us are cows alike and verily if god please we shall be guidedrightly he said god saith she is a cow not worn by ploughing the earth orwatering the field sound no blemish in her they said now hast thoubrought the truth then they sacrificed her yet nearly had they done itnot and when ye slew a man and strove among yourselves about him god brought tolight what he had hidden for we said strike the corpse with part of her so god giveth life to thedead and sheweth you his signs that haply ye may understand then after that your hearts became hard like rocks or harder still forverily from rocks have rivers gushed others verily have been cleft andwater hath issued from them and others verily have sunk down through fearof god and god is not regardless of your actions desire ye then that for your sakes the jews should believe yet a part ofthem heard the word of god and then after they had understood it pervertedit and knew that they did so and when they fall in with the faithful they say we believe but whenthey are apart one with another they say will ye acquaint them with whatgod hath revealed to you that they may dispute with you about it in thepresence of your lord understand ye their aim know they not that god knoweth what they hide as well as what they bring tolight but there are illiterates among them who are unacquainted with the book but with lies only and have but vague fancies woe to those who with theirown hands transcribe the book corruptly and then say this is from god that they may sell it for some mean price woe then to them for that whichtheir hands have written and woe to them for the gains which they havemade and they say hell fire shall not touch us but for a few days say haveye received such a promise from god for god will not revoke his promise or speak ye of god that which ye know not but they whose only gains are evil works and who are environed by theirsins they shall be inmates of the fire therein to abide for ever but they who have believed and done the things that be right they shall bethe inmates of paradise therein to abide for ever and when we entered into covenant with the children of israel we said worship none but god and be good to your parents and kindred and toorphans and to the poor and speak with men what is right and observeprayer and pay the stated alms then turned ye away except a few of you and withdrew afar off and when we made a covenant with you that ye should not shed your ownblood nor expel one another from your abodes then ye ratified it andyourselves were witnesses then were ye the very persons who slew one another and ye drove out a partof your own people from their abodes ye lent help against them with wrongand hatred but if they come captives to you ye redeem them yet it wasforbidden you to drive them out believe ye then part of the book and denypart but what shall be the meed of him among you who doth this but shame inthis life and on the day of the resurrection they shall be sent to the mostcruel of torments for god is not regardless of what ye do these are they who purchase this present life at the price of that which isto come their torment shall not be lightened neither shall they be helped moreover to moses gave we the book and we raised up apostles after him and to jesus son of mary gave we clear proofs of his mission andstrengthened him by the holy spirit so oft then as an apostle cometh toyou with that which your souls desire not swell ye with pride and treatsome as impostors and slay others and they say uncircumcised are our hearts nay god hath cursed them intheir infidelity few are they who believe and when a book had come to them from god confirming that which they hadreceived already although they had before prayed for victory over those whobelieved not yet when that koran come to them of which they had knowledge they did not recognise it the curse of god on the infidels for a vile price have they sold themselves by not believing what god hathsent down envious of god s sending down his grace on such of his servants ashe pleaseth and they have brought on themselves wrath upon wrath and forthe unbelievers is a disgraceful chastisement and when it is said to them believe in what god hath sent down they say in that which hath been sent down to us we believe but what hath sincebeen sent down they disbelieve although it be the truth confirmatory oftheir own scriptures say why then have ye of old slain god s prophets ifye are indeed believers moreover moses came unto you with proofs of his mission then in his absenceye took the calf for your god and did wickedly and when we accepted your covenant and uplifted the mountain over you wesaid take firm hold on what we have given you and hearken they said wehave hearkened and have rebelled then were they made to drink down the calfinto their hearts for their ingratitude say a bad thing hath your faithcommanded you if ye be indeed believers say if the future dwelling place with god be specially for you but not forthe rest of mankind then wish for death if ye are sincere but never can they wish for it because of that which their own hands havesent on before them and god knoweth the offenders and thou wilt surely find them of all men most covetous of life beyond eventhe polytheists to be kept alive a thousand years might one of them desire but that he may be preserved alive shall no one reprieve himself from thepunishment and god seeth what they do say whoso is the enemy of gabriel for he it is who by god s leave hathcaused the koran to descend on thy heart the confirmation of previousrevelations and guidance and good tidings to the faithful whoso is an enemy to god or his angels or to gabriel or to michael shallhave god as his enemy for verily god is an enemy to the infidels moreover clear signs have we sent down to thee and none will disbelievethem but the perverse oft as they have formed an engagement with thee will some of them set itaside but most of them believe not and when there came to them an apostle from god affirming the previousrevelations made to them some of those to whom the scriptures were given threw the book of god behind their backs as if they knew it not and they followed what the satans read in the reign of solomon not thatsolomon was unbelieving but the satans were unbelieving sorcery did theyteach to men and what had been revealed to the two angels harut and marut at babel yet no man did these two teach until they had said we are only atemptation be not then an unbeliever from these two did men learn how tocause division between man and wife but unless by leave of god no man didthey harm thereby they learned indeed what would harm and not profit them and yet they knew that he who bought that art should have no part in the lifeto come and vile the price for which they have sold themselves if they hadbut known it but had they believed and feared god better surely would have been thereward from god if they had but known it o ye who believe say not to our apostle raina look at us but say ondhorna regard us and attend to this for the infidels shall suffer agrievous chastisement the unbelievers among the people of the book and among the idolaters desirenot that any good should be sent down to you from your lord but god willshew his special mercy to whom he will for he is of great bounty whatever verses we cancel or cause thee to forget we bring a better orits like knowest thou not that god hath power over all things knowest thou not that the dominion of the heavens and of the earth is god s and that ye have neither patron nor helper save god would ye ask of your apostle what of old was asked of moses but he whoexchangeth faith for unbelief hath already erred from the even way many of the people of the book desire to bring you back to unbelief after yehave believed out of selfish envy even after the truth hath been clearlyshewn them but forgive them and shun them till god shall come in with hisworking truly god hath power over all things and observe prayer and pay the legal impost and whatever good thing yehave sent on before for your soul s sake ye shall find it with god verilygod seeth what ye do and they say none but jews or christians shall enter paradise this istheir wish say give your proofs if ye speak the truth but they who set their face with resignation godward and do what is right their reward is with their lord no fear shall come on them neither shallthey be grieved moreover the jews say the christians lean on nought on nought lean thejews say the christians yet both are readers of the book so with likewords say they who have no knowledge but on the resurrection day godshall judge between them as to that in which they differ and who committeth a greater wrong than he who hindereth god s name frombeing remembered in his temples and who hasteth to ruin them such mencannot enter them but with fear their s is shame in this world and a severetorment in the next the east and the west is god s therefore whichever way ye turn there isthe face of god truly god is immense and knoweth all and they say god hath a son no praise be to him but his whatever isin the heavens and the earth all obeyeth him sole maker of the heavens and of the earth and when he decreeth a thing heonly saith to it be and it is and they who have no knowledge say unless god speak to us or thou shew usa sign so with like words said those who were before them theirhearts are alike clear signs have we already shewn for those who have firmfaith verily with the truth have we sent thee a bearer of good tidings and awarner and of the people of hell thou shalt not be questioned but until thou follow their religion neither jews nor christians will besatisfied with thee say verily guidance of god that is the guidance andif after the knowledge which hath reached thee thou follow their desires thou shalt find neither helper nor protector against god they to whom we have given the book and who read it as it ought to be read these believe therein but whoso believeth not therein shall meet withperdition o children of israel remember my favour wherewith i have favoured you andthat high above all mankind have i raised you and dread the day when not in aught shall soul satisfy for soul nor shallany ransom be taken from it nor shall any intercession avail and they shallnot be helped when his lord made trial of abraham by commands which he fulfilled he said i am about to make thee an imâm to mankind he said of my offspringalso my covenant said god embraceth not the evil doers and remember when we appointed the holy house as man s resort and saferetreat and said take ye the station of abraham for a place of prayer and we commanded abraham and ismael purify my house for those who shall goin procession round it and those who shall abide there for devotion andthose who shall bow down and prostrate themselves and when abraham said lord make this secure land and supply its peoplewith fruits such of them as believe in god and in the last day he said and whoso believeth not for a little while will i bestow good things onhim then will i drive him to the torment of the fire an ill passage and when abraham with ismael raised the foundations of the house theysaid o our lord accept it from us for thou art the hearer the knower o our lord make us also muslims and our posterity a muslim people andteach us our holy rites and be turned towards us for thou art he whoturneth the merciful o our lord raise up among them an apostle who may rehearse thy signs untothem and teach them the book and wisdom and purify them for thou artthe mighty the wise and who but he that hath debased his soul to folly will mislike the faith ofabraham when we have chosen him in this world and in the world to come heshall be of the just when his lord said to him resign thyself to me he said i resign myselfto the lord of the worlds and this to his children did abraham bequeath and jacob also saying o mychildren truly god hath chosen a religion for you so die not unless ye bealso muslims were ye present when jacob was at the point of death when he said to hissons whom will ye worship when i am gone they said we will worship thygod and the god of thy fathers abraham and ismael and isaac one god and tohim are we surrendered muslims that people have now passed away they have the reward of their deeds and yeshall have the meed of yours but of their doings ye shall not be questioned they say moreover become jews or christians that ye may have the trueguidance say nay the religion of abraham the sound in faith and notone of those who join gods with god say ye we believe in god and that which hath been sent down to us andthat which hath been sent down to abraham and ismael and isaac and jacob andthe tribes and that which hath been given to moses and to jesus and thatwhich was given to the prophets from their lord no difference do we makebetween any of them and to god are we resigned muslims if therefore they believe even as ye believe then have they true guidance but if they turn back then do they cut themselves off from you and god willsuffice to protect thee against them for he is the hearer the knower islam is the baptism of god and who is better to baptise than god and himdo we serve say will ye dispute with us about god when he is our lord and your lord wehave our works and ye have your works and we are sincerely his will ye say verily abraham and ismael and isaac and jacob and thetribes were jews or christians say who knoweth best ye or god and whois more in fault than he who concealeth the witness which he hath from god but god is not regardless of what ye do that people have now passed away they have the reward of their deeds andfor you is the meed of yours but of their doings ye shall not be questioned the foolish ones will say what hath turned them from the kebla which theyused say the east and the west are god s he guideth whom he will into theright path thus have we made you a central people that ye may be witnesses in regardto mankind and that the apostle may be a witness in regard to you we appointed the kebla which thou formerly hadst only that we might know himwho followeth the apostle from him who turneth on his heels the change is adifficulty but not to those whom god hath guided but god will not let yourfaith be fruitless for unto man is god merciful gracious we have seen thee turning thy face towards every part of heaven but we willhave thee turn to a kebla which shall please thee turn then thy face towardsthe sacred mosque and wherever ye be turn your faces towards that part they verily to whom the book hath been given know this to be the truthfrom their lord and god is not regardless of what ye do even though thou shouldest bring every kind of sign to those who havereceived the scriptures yet thy kebla they will not adopt nor shalt thouadopt their kebla nor will one part of them adopt the kebla of the other and if after the knowledge which hath come to thee thou follow theirwishes verily then wilt thou become of the unrighteous they to whom we have given the scriptures know him the apostle even as theyknow their own children but truly a part of them do conceal the truth though acquainted with it the truth is from thy lord be not then of those who doubt all have a quarter of the heavens to which they turn them but wherever yebe hasten emulously after good god will one day bring you all together verily god is all powerful and from whatever place thou comest forth turn thy face toward the sacredmosque for this is the truth from thy lord and god is not inattentive toyour doings and from whatever place thou comest forth turn thy face toward the sacredmosque and wherever ye be to that part turn your faces lest men have causeof dispute against you but as for the impious among them fear them not butfear me that i may perfect my favours on you and that ye may be guidedaright and we sent to you an apostle from among yourselves to rehearse our signsunto you and to purify you and to instruct you in the book and in thewisdom and to teach you that which ye knew not therefore remember me i will remember you and give me thanks and be notungrateful o ye who believe seek help with patience and with prayer for god is withthe patient and say not of those who are slain on god s path that they are dead nay they are living but ye understand not with somewhat of fear and hunger and loss of wealth and lives and fruits will we surely prove you but bear good tidings to the patient who when a mischance chanceth them say verily we are god s and to himshall we return on them shall be blessings from their lord and mercy and these they arethe rightly guided verily safa and marwah are among the monuments of god whoever then maketha pilgrimage to the temple or visiteth it shall not be to blame if he goround about them both and as for him who of his own accord doeth what isgood god is grateful knowing they who conceal aught that we have sent down either of clear proof or ofguidance after what we have so clearly shewn to men in the book god shallcurse them and they who curse shall curse them but as for those who turn to me and amend and make known the truth evenunto them will i turn me for i am he who turneth the merciful verily they who are infidels and die infidels these upon them shall be themalison of god and of angels and of all men under it shall they remain for ever their torment shall not be lightened and god will not even look upon them your god is one god there is no god but he the compassionate themerciful assuredly in the creation of the heavens and of the earth and in thealternation of night and day and in the ships which pass through the seawith what is useful to man and in the rain which god sendeth down fromheaven giving life by it to the earth after its death and by scatteringover it all kinds of cattle and in the change of the winds and in theclouds that are made to do service between the heaven and the earth aresigns for those who understand yet there are men who take to them idols along with god and love them withthe love of god but stronger in the faithful is the love of god oh theimpious will see when they see their chastisement that all power is god s and that god is severe in chastising when those who have had followers shall declare themselves clear from theirfollowers after that they have seen the chastisement and when the tiesbetween them shall be cut asunder the followers shall say could we but return to life we would keep ourselvesclear from them as they have declared themselves clear of us so will godshew them their works sighing is upon them but forth from the fire theycome not oh men eat of that which is lawful and good on the earth but follow not thesteps of satan for he is your avowed enemy he only enjoineth you evil and wickedness and that ye should aver of godthat which ye know not and when it is said to them follow ye that which god hath sent down theysay nay we follow the usages which we found with our fathers what though their fathers were utterly ignorant and devoid of guidance the infidels resemble him who shouteth aloud to one who heareth no more thana call and cry deaf dumb blind therefore they have no understanding o ye who believe eat of the good things with which we have supplied you andgive god thanks if ye are his worshippers but that which dieth of itself and blood and swine s flesh and that overwhich any other name than that of god hath been invoked is forbidden you but he who shall partake of them by constraint without lust or wilfulness no sin shall be upon him verily god is indulgent merciful they truly who hide the scriptures which god hath sent down and barter themfor a mean price these shall swallow into their bellies nought but fire godwill not speak to them or assoil them on the day of the resurrection andtheirs shall be a grievous torment these are they who have bartered guidance for error and pardon for torment but how great their endurance in fire this shall be their doom because god had sent down the book with the verytruth and verily they who dispute about that book are in a far goneseverance from it there is no piety in turning your faces toward the east or the west but heis pious who believeth in god and the last day and the angles and thescriptures and the prophets who for the love of god disburseth his wealthto his kindred and to the orphans and the needy and the wayfarer andthose who ask and for ransoming who observeth prayer and payeth the legalalms and who is of those who are faithful to their engagements when theyhave engaged in them and patient under ills and hardships and in time oftrouble these are they who are just and these are they who fear the lord o believers retaliation for bloodshedding is prescribed to you the free manfor the free and the slave for the slave and the woman for the woman buthe to whom his brother shall make any remission is to be dealt withequitably and to him should he pay a fine with liberality this is a relaxation from your lord and a mercy for him who after hisshall transgress a sore punishment but in this law of retaliation is your security for life o men ofunderstanding to the intent that ye may fear god it is prescribed to you when any one of you is at the point of death if heleave goods that he bequeath equitably to his parents and kindred this isbinding on those who fear god but as for him who after he hath heard thebequest shall change it surely the wrong of this shall be on those whochange it verily god heareth knoweth but he who feareth from the testator any mistake or wrong and shall make asettlement between the parties that shall be no wrong in him verily god islenient merciful o believers a fast is prescribed to you as it was prescribed to those beforeyou that ye may fear god for certain days but he among you who shall be sick or on a journey shallfast that same number of other days and as for those who are able to keep itand yet break it the expiation of this shall be the maintenance of a poorman and he who of his own accord performeth a good work shall derive goodfrom it and good shall it be for you to fast if ye knew it as to the month ramadhan in which the koran was sent down to be man sguidance and an explanation of that guidance and of that illumination assoon as any one of you observeth the moon let him set about the fast but hewho is sick or upon a journey shall fast a like number of other days godwisheth you ease but wisheth not your discomfort and that you fulfil thenumber of days and that you glorify god for his guidance and that you bethankful and when my servants ask thee concerning me then will i be nigh unto them iwill answer the cry of him that crieth when he crieth unto me but let themhearken unto me and believe in me that they may proceed aright you are allowed on the night of the fast to approach your wives they areyour garment and ye are their garment god knoweth that ye defraudyourselves therein so he turneth unto you and forgiveth you now therefore go in unto them with full desire for that which god hath ordained for you and eat and drink until ye can discern a white thread from a black threadby the daybreak then fast strictly till night and go not in unto them butrather pass the time in the mosques these are the bounds set up by god therefore come not near them thus god maketh his signs clear to men thatthey may fear him consume not your wealth among yourselves in vain things nor present it tojudges that ye may consume a part of other men s wealth unjustly while yeknow the sin which ye commit they will ask thee of the new moons say they are periods fixed for man sservice and for the pilgrimage there is no piety in entering your houses atthe back but piety consists in the fear of god enter your houses then bytheir doors and fear god that it may be well with you and fight for the cause of god against those who fight against you butcommit not the injustice of attacking them first god loveth not suchinjustice and kill them wherever ye shall find them and eject them from whatever placethey have ejected you for civil discord is worse than carnage yet attackthem not at the sacred mosque unless they attack you therein but if theyattack you slay them such the reward of the infidels but if they desist then verily god is gracious merciful fight therefore against them until there be no more civil discord and theonly worship be that of god but if they desist then let there be nohostility save against the wicked the sacred month and the sacred precincts are under the safeguard ofreprisals whoever offereth violence to you offer ye the like violence tohim and fear god and know that god is with those who fear him give freely for the cause of god and throw not yourselves with your ownhands into ruin and do good for god loveth those who do good accomplish the pilgrimage and the visitation of the holy places in honourof god and if ye be hemmed in by foes send whatever offering shall be theeasiest and shave not your heads until the offering reach the place ofsacrifice but whoever among you is sick or hath an ailment of the head must satisfy by fasting or alms or an offering and when ye are safe fromfoes he who contents himself with the visitation of the holy places untilthe pilgrimage shall bring whatever offering shall be the easiest but hewho findeth nothing to offer shall fast three days in the pilgrimage itself and seven days when ye return they shall be ten days in all this is bindingon him whose family shall not be present at the sacred mosque and fear god and know that god is terrible in punishing let the pilgrimage be made in the months already known whoever thereforeundertaketh the pilgrimage therein let him not know a woman nor transgress nor wrangle in the pilgrimage the good which ye do god knoweth it andprovide for your journey but the best provision is the fear of god fear me then o men of understanding it shall be no crime in you if ye seek an increase from your lord and whenye pour swiftly on from arafat then remember god near the holy monument andremember him because he hath guided you who before this were of those whowent astray then pass on quickly where the people quickly pass and ask pardon of god for god is forgiving merciful and when ye have finished your holy rites remember god as ye remember yourown fathers or with a yet more intense remembrance some men there are whosay o our lord give us our portion in this world but such shall have noportion in the next life and some say o our lord give us good in this world and good in the next and keep us from the torment of the fire they shall have the lot which they have merited and god is swift to reckon bear god in mind during the stated days but if any haste away in two days it shall be no fault in him and if any tarry longer it shall be no fault inhim if he fear god fear god then and know that to him shall ye begathered a man there is who surpriseth thee by his discourse concerning this lifepresent he taketh god to witness what is in his heart yet is he the mostzealous in opposing thee and when he turneth his back on thee he runneth through the land to enactdisorders therein and layeth waste the fields and flocks but god loveth notthe disorder and when it is said to him fear god the pride of sin seizeth him but heshall have his fill of hell and right wretched the couch a man too there is who selleth his very self out of desire to please god and god is good to his servants o believers enter completely into the true religion and follow not thesteps of satan for he is your declared enemy but if ye lapse after that our clear signs have come to you know that godis mighty wise what can such expect but that god should come down to them overshadowed withclouds and the angels also and their doom be sealed and to god shall allthings return ask the children of isreal how many clear signs we have given them but ifany man shall alter the boon of god after it shall have reached him assuredly god will be vehement in punishing him this present life is prepared for those who believe not and who mock at thefaithful but they who fear god shall be above them on the day ofresurrection and god is bounteous without measure to whom he will mankind was but one people and god sent prophets to announce glad tidingsand to warn and he sent down with them the book of truth that it mightdecide the disputes of men and none disputed but those to whom the book hadbeen given after the clear tokens had reached them being full of mutualjealousy and god guided those who believed to the truth of that about which by his permission they had disputed for god guideth whom he pleaseth intothe straight path think ye to enter paradise when no such things have come upon you as onthose who flourish before you ills and troubles tried them and so tossedwere they by trials that the apostle and they who shared his faith said when will the help of god come is not the help of god nigh they will ask thee what they shall bestow in alms say let the good which yebestow be for parents and kindred and orphans and the poor and thewayfarer and whatever good ye do of a truth god knoweth war is prescribed to you but from this ye are averse yet haply ye are averse from a thing though it be good for you and haply yelove a thing though it be bad for you and god knoweth but ye ye know not they will ask thee concerning war in the sacred month say to war therein isbad but to turn aside from the cause of god and to have no faith in him and in the sacred temple and to drive out its people is worse in the sightof god and civil strife is worse than bloodshed they will not cease to waragainst you until they turn you from your religion if they be able butwhoever of you shall turn from his religion and die an infidel their worksshall be fruitless in this world and in the next they shall be consigned tothe fire therein to abide for aye but they who believe and who fly their country and fight in the cause ofgod may hope for god s mercy and god is gracious merciful they will ask thee concerning wine and games of chance say in both isgreat sin and advantage also to men but their sin is greater than theiradvantage they will ask thee also what they shall bestow in alms say what ye can spare thus god sheweth you his signs that ye may ponderon this present world and on the next they will also ask thee concerningorphans say fair dealing with them is best but if ye mix yourselves up in their affairs they are your brethren godknoweth the foul dealer from the fair and if god pleased he could indeedafflict you verily god is mighty wise marry not idolatresses until they believe a slave who believeth is betterthan an idolatress though she please you more and wed not your daughters toidolaters until they believe for a slave who is a believer is than betteran idolater though he please you they invite to the fire but god inviteth to paradise and to pardon if heso will and maketh clear his signs to men that they may remember they will also question thee as to the courses of women say they are apollution separate yourselves therefore from women and approach them not until they be cleansed but when they are cleansed go in unto them as godhath ordained for you verily god loveth those who turn to him and loveththose who seek to be clean your wives are your field go in therefore to your field as ye will but dofirst some act for your souls good and fear ye god and know that ye mustmeet him and bear these good tidings to the faithful swear not by god when ye make oath that ye will be virtuous and fear god and promote peace among men for god is he who heareth knoweth god will not punish you for a mistake in your oaths but he will punish youfor that which your hearts have done god is gracious merciful they who intend to abstain from their wives shall wait four months but ifthey go back from their purpose then verily god is gracious merciful and if they resolve on a divorce then verily god is he who heareth knoweth the divorced shall wait the result until they have had their courses thrice nor ought they to conceal what god hath created in their wombs if theybelieve in god and the last day and it will be more just in their husbandsto bring them back when in this state if they desire what is right and itis for the women to act as they the husbands act by them in all fairness but the men are a step above them god is mighty wise ye may divorce your wives twice keep them honourably or put them away withkindness but it is not allowed you to appropriate to yourselves aught ofwhat ye have given to them unless both fear that they cannot keep within thebounds set up by god and if ye fear that they cannot observe theordinances of god no blame shall attach to either of you for what the wifeshall herself give for her redemption these are the bounds of god thereforeoverstep them not for whoever oversteppeth the bounds of god they are evildoers but if the husband divorce her a third time it is not lawful for him to takeher again until she shall have married another husband and if he alsodivorce her then shall no blame attach to them if they return to each other thinking that they can keep within the bounds fixed by god and these are thebounds of god he maketh them clear to those who have knowledge but when ye divorce women and the time for sending them away is come eitherretain them with generosity or put them away with generosity but retainthem not by constraint so as to be unjust towards them he who doth so dothin fact injure himself and make not the signs of god a jest but remembergod s favour toward you and the book and the wisdom which he hath sent downto you for your warning and fear god and know that god s knowledgeembraceth everything and when ye divorce your wives and they have waited the prescribed time hinder them not from marrying their husbands when they have agreed amongthemselves in an honourable way this warning is for him among you whobelieveth in god and in the last day this is most pure for you and mostdecent god knoweth but ye know not mothers when divorced shall give suck to their children two full years if the father desire that the suckling be completed and such maintenance andclothing as is fair for them shall devolve on the father no person shall becharged beyond his means a mother shall not be pressed unfairly for herchild nor a father for his child and the same with the father s heir butif they choose to wean the child by consent and by bargain it shall be nofault in them and if ye choose to have a nurse for your children it shallbe no fault in you in case ye pay what ye promised her according to thatwhich is fair fear god and know that god seeth what ye do if those of you who die leave wives they must await their state during fourmonths and ten days and when this their term is expired you shall not beanswerable for the way in which they shall dispose of themselves fairly andgod is cognisant of what ye do and then shall no blame attach to you in making proposals of marriage tosuch women or in keeping such intention to yourselves god knoweth that yewill not forget them but promise them not in secret unless ye speakhonourable words and resolve not on the marriage tie until the prescribed time be reached andknow that god knoweth what is in your minds therefore beware of him andknow that god is gracious mild it shall be no crime in you if ye divorce your wives so long as ye have notconsummated the marriage nor settled any dowry on them and provide what isneedful for them he who is in ample circumstances according to his means andhe who is straitened according to his means with fairness this is bindingon those who do what is right but if ye divorce them before consummation and have already settled a dowryon them ye shall give them half of what ye have settled unless they make arelease or he make a release in whose hand is the marriage tie but if yemake a release it will be nearer to piety and forget not generosity in yourrelations one towards another for god beholdeth your doings observe strictly the prayers and the middle prayer and stand up full ofdevotion towards god and if you have any alarm then pray on foot or riding but when you aresafe then remember god how he hath made you to know what ye knew not and such of you as shall die and leave wives shall bequeath their wives ayear s maintenance without causing them to quit their homes but if they quitthem of their own accord then no blame shall attach to you for anydisposition they may make of themselves in a fair way and god is mighty wise and for the divorced let there be a fair provision this is a duty in thosewho fear god thus god maketh his signs clear to you that ye may understand hast thou not thought on those who quitted their dwellings and they werethousands for fear of death god said to them die then he restored themto life for full of bounty towards man is god but most men give not thanks fight for the cause of god and know that god is he who heareth knoweth who is he that will lend to god a goodly loan he will double it to him againand again god is close but open handed also and to him shall ye return hast thou not considered the assembly of the children of israel after thedeath of moses when they said to a prophet of theirs set up for us a king we will do battle for the cause of god he said may it not be that if tofight were ordained you ye would not fight they said and why should wenot fight in the cause of god since we and our children are driven forthfrom our dwellings but when fighting was commanded them they turned back save a few of them but god knew the offenders and their prophet said to them now hath god set talout saul king overyou they said how shall he reign over us when we are more worthy of thekingdom than he and of wealth he hath no abundance he said verily godhath chosen him to be over you and hath given him increase in knowledge andstature god giveth his kingdom to whom he pleaseth and god is liberal knowing and their prophet said to them verily the sign of his kingship shall bethat the ark shall come to you in it is a pledge of security from yourlord and the relics left by the family of moses and the family of aaron the angels shall bear it truly herein shall be a sign indeed to you if yeare believers and when saul marched forth with his forces he said god will test you by ariver he who drinketh of it shall not be of my band but he who shall nottaste it drinking a drink out of the hand excepted shall be of my band and except a few of them they drank of it and when they had passed it heand those who believed with him the former said we have no strength thisday against djalout goliath and his forces but they who held it ascertain that they must meet god said how oft by god s will hath a smallhost vanquished a numerous host and god is with the steadfastly enduring and when they went forth against goliath and his forces they said o ourlord pour out steadfastness upon us and set our feet firm and help usagainst the infidels and by the will of god they routed them and daood david slew goliath andgod gave him the kingship and wisdom and taught him according to his will and were it not for the restraint of one by means of the other imposed onmen by god verily the earth had been utterly corrupted but god is bounteousto his creatures such are the signs of god with truth do we rehearse them to thee for one ofthe sent ones art thou some of the apostles we have endowed more highly than others those to whomgod hath spoken he hath raised to the loftiest grade and to jesus the sonof mary we gave manifest signs and we strengthened him with the holyspirit and if god had pleased they who came after them would not havewrangled after the clear signs had reached them but into disputes theyfell some of them believed and some were infidels yet if god had pleased they would not have thus wrangled but god doth what he will o believers give alms of that with which we have supplied you before theday cometh when there shall be no trafficking nor friendship norintercession and the infidels are the wrong doers god there is no god but he the living the eternal nor slumber seizethhim nor sleep his whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in theearth who is he that can intercede with him but by his own permission heknoweth what hath been before them and what shall be after them yet noughtof his knowledge shall they grasp save what he willeth his throne reachethover the heavens and the earth and the upholding of both burdeneth him not and he is the high the great let there be no compulsion in religion now is the right way made distinctfrom error whoever therefore shall deny thagout and believe in god hewill have taken hold on a strong handle that shall not be broken and god ishe who heareth knoweth god is the patron of believers he shall bring them out of darkness intolight as to those who believe not their patrons are thagout they shall bring themout of light into darkness they shall be given over to the fire they shallabide therein for ever hast thou not thought on him who disputed with abraham about his lord because god had given him the kingdom when abraham said my lord is he whomaketh alive and cause to die he said it is i who make alive and cause todie abraham said since god bringeth the sun from the east do thou then bring it from the west the infidel was confounded for god guideth not theevil doers or how he demeaned him who passed by a city which had been laid inruins how said he shall god give life to this city after she hathbeen dead and god caused him to die for an hundred years and then raisedhim to life and god said how long hast thou waited he said i havewaited a day or part of a day he said nay thou hast waited an hundredyears look on thy food and thy drink they are not corrupted and look onthine ass we would make thee a sign unto men and look on the bones of thineass how we will raise them then clothe them with flesh and when this wasshewn to him he said i acknowledge that god hath power to do all things when abraham said o lord shew me how thou wilt give life to the dead hesaid hast thou not believed he said yes but i have asked thee that my heart may be well assured hesaid take then four birds and draw them towards thee and cut them inpieces then place a part of them on every mountain then call them and theyshall come swiftly to thee and know thou that god is might wise the likeness of those who expend their wealth for the cause of god is thatof a grain of corn which produceth seven ears and in each ear a hundredgrains and god will multiply to whom he pleaseth god is liberal knowing they who expend their wealth for the cause of god and never follow what theyhave laid out with reproaches or harm shall have their reward with theirlord no fear shall come upon them neither shall they be put to grief a kind speech and forgiveness is better than alms followed by injury god isrich clement o ye who believe make not your alms void by reproaches and injury like himwho spendeth his substance to be seen of men and believeth not in god and inthe latter day the likeness of such an one is that of a rock with a thinsoil upon it on which a heavy rain falleth but leaveth it hard no profitfrom their works shall they be able to gain for god guideth not theunbelieving people and the likeness of those who expend their substance from a desire to pleasegod and for the stablishing of their souls is as a garden on a hill onwhich the heavy rain falleth and it yieldeth its fruits twofold and even ifa heavy rain fall not on it yet is there a dew god beholdeth your actions desireth any one of you a garden of palms and vines through which riversflow in which he may have every fruit and that old age should surprise himthere and that his offspring should be weakly and that then a fiery violentwind shall strike it so that it shall be burned thus god maketh plain hissigns to you that ye may reflect o ye who believe bestow alms of the good things which ye have acquired andof that which we have brought forth for you out of the earth and choose notthe bad for almsgiving such as ye would accept yourselves only by connivance and know that god isrich praiseworthy satan menaceth you with poverty and enjoineth base actions but godpromiseth you pardon from himself and abundance god is all bounteous knowing he giveth wisdom to whom he will and he to whom wisdom is given hath hadmuch good given him but none will bear it in mind except the wise of heart and whatever alms ye shall give or whatever vow ye shall vow of a truth godknoweth it but they who act unjustly shall have no helpers give ye youralms openly it is well do ye conceal them and give them to the poor this too will be of advantage to you and will do away your sins and godis cognisant of your actions their guidance is not thine affair o muhammad but god guideth whom hepleaseth and the good that ye shall give in alms shall redound untoyourselves and ye shall not give but as seeking the face of god andwhatever good thing ye shall have given in alms shall be repaid you and yeshall not be wronged there are among you the poor who being shut up tofighting for the cause of god have it not in their power to strike out intothe earth for riches those who know them not think them rich because oftheir modesty by this their token thou shalt know them they ask not of menwith importunity and of whatever good thing ye shall give them in alms of atruth god will take knowledge they who give away their substance in alms by night and day in private andin public shall have their reward with their lord no fear shall come onthem neither shall they be put to grief they who swallow down usury shall arise in the resurrection only as heariseth whom satan hath infected by his touch this for that they say selling is only the like of usury and yet god hath allowed selling andforbidden usury he then who when this warning shall come to him from hislord abstaineth shall have pardon for the past and his lot shall be withgod but they who return to usury shall be given over to the fire thereinshall they abide for ever god will bring usury to nought but will increase alms with usury and godloveth no infidel or evil person but they who believe and do the thingsthat are right and observe the prayers and pay the legal impost they shallhave their reward with their lord no fear shall come on them neither shallthey be put to grief o believers fear god and abandon your remaining usury if ye are indeedbelievers but if ye do it not then hearken for war on the part of god and his apostle yet if ye repent ye shall have the principal of your money wrong not andye shall not be wronged if any one find difficulty in discharging a debt then let there be a delayuntil it be easy for him but if ye remit it as alms it will be better foryou if ye knew it fear the day wherein ye shall return to god then shall every soul berewarded according to its desert and none shall have injustice done to them o ye who believe when ye contract a debt payable at a fixed date write itdown and let the notary faithfully note between you and let not the notaryrefuse to note even as god hath taught him but let him note it down andlet him who oweth the debt dictate and let him fear god his lord and notdiminish aught thereof but if he who oweth the debt be foolish or weak orbe not able to dictate himself let his friend dictate for him with fairness and call to witness two witnesses of your people but if there be not twomen let there be a man and two women of those whom ye shall judge fit forwitnesses if the one of them should mistake the other may cause her torecollect and the witnesses shall not refuse whenever they shall besummoned and disdain not to put the debt in writing be it large or small with its time of payment this will be more just for you in the sight of god better suited for witnessing and the best for avoiding doubt but if thegoods be there present and ye pass them from hand to hand then it shall beno fault in you not to write it down and have witnesses when ye sell andharm not writer or witness it will be a crime in you to do this but feargod and god will give you knowledge for god hath knowledge of all things and if ye be on a journey and shall find no notary let pledges be taken butif one of you trust the other let him who is trusted restore what he istrusted with and fear god his lord and refuse not to give evidence he whorefuseth is

apostle from amongthemselves to rehearse his signs to them and to purify them and to impartto them a knowledge of the book and wisdom for aforetime were they inmanifest error and others among them have not yet overtaken those who preceded them in thefaith but he is the mighty the wise this is the goodness of god he bestoweth it on whom he will god is ofimmense goodness they on whom the burden of the law was laid and would not bear it are likean ass beneath a load of books a sorry likeness this for the people whogive the lie to the signs of god god guideth not the people who do thiswrong say o ye jews if ye profess that ye rather than other men are the friendsof god then wish for death if ye are men of truth but never on account of their previous handywork will they wish for it andgod knoweth the wrong doers say verily the death from which ye flee will surely meet you then shall yebe brought back to him who knoweth alike the things done in secret andopenly and he will tell you of your actions o ye who believe when ye are summoned to prayer on the day of the assembly haste to the commemoration of god and quit your traffic this if ye knewit will be best for you and when the prayer is ended then disperse yourselves abroad and go in questof the bounties of god and that it may be well with you oft remember god but when they get a sight of merchandise or sport they disperse after it and leave thee standing alone say god hath in reserve what is better thansport or wares and god is the best provider friday the day on which muhammad made his first entry into medina and theday on which creation was finished it is said that when muhammad was preaching dahya alkalbi while yet aheathen came on a friday into medina at the head of a caravan and thatall the congregation attracted by the music of the tambours which precededit left the sermon for the spectacle muquâtil ap alfarrâ if this accountbe accurate we may approximate to the date of this sura as in hej towards the close dahya is known to have fought in the ranks of themuslims at the battle of the ditch and as the former part is aimed at thejews it is probably of the same period as sura xci ii sura viii the spoils xcv medina versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulthey will question thee about the spoils say the spoils are god s and theapostle s therefore fear god and settle this among yourselves and obeygod and his apostle if you are believers believers are they only whose hearts thrill with fear when god is named andwhose faith increaseth at each recital of his signs and who put their trustin their lord who observe the prayers and give alms out of that with which we havesupplied them these are the believers their due grade awaiteth them in the presence oftheir lord and forgiveness and a generous provision remember how thy lord caused thee to go forth from thy home on a mission oftruth and part of the believers were quite averse to it they disputed with thee about the truth which had been made so clear as ifthey were being led forth to death and saw it before them and remember when god promised you that one of the two troops should fall toyou and ye desired that they who had no arms should fall to you but godpurposed to prove true the truth of his words and to cut off the uttermostpart ofthe infidels that he might prove his truth to be the truth and bring to nought that whichis nought though the impious were averse to it when ye sought succour of your lord and he answered you i will verily aidyou with a thousand angels rank on rank and god made this promise as pure good tidings and to assure your hearts byit for succour cometh from god alone verily god is mighty wise recollect when sleep a sign of security from him fell upon you and he sentdown upon you water from heaven that he might thereby cleanse you and causethe pollution of satan to pass from you and that he might gird up yourhearts and stablish your feet by it when thy lord spake unto the angels i will be with you therefore stablishye the faithful i will cast a dread into the hearts of the infidels strikeoff their heads then and strike off from them every finger tip this because they have opposed god and his apostle and whoso shall opposegod and his apostle verily god will be severe in punishment this for you taste it then and for the infidels is the torture of thefire o ye who believe when ye meet the marshalled hosts of the infidels turn notyour backs to them whoso shall turn his back to them on that day unless he turn aside to fight or to rally to some other troop shall incur wrath from god hell shall behis abode and wretched the journey thither so it was not ye who slew them but god slew them and those shafts weregod s not thine he would make trial of the faithful by a gracious trialfrom himself verily god heareth knoweth this befel that god might also bring to nought the craft of the infidels o meccans if ye desired a decision now hath the decision come to you itwill be better for you if ye give over the struggle if ye return to it wewill return and your forces though they be many shall never avail youaught for god is with the faithful o ye faithful obey god and his apostle and turn not away from him now thatye hear the truth and be not like those who say we hear when they hear not for the vilest beasts in god s sight are the deaf the dumb who understandnot had god known any good in them he would certainly have made them hear buteven if he had made them hear they would certainly have turned back andwithdrawn afar o ye faithful make answer to the appeal of god and his apostle when hecalleth you to that which giveth you life know that god cometh in between aman and his own heart and that to him shall ye be gathered and be afraid of temptation the evil doers among you will not be the onlyones on whom it will light and know ye that god is severe in punishment and remember when ye were few and reputed weak in the land ye feared lestmen should pluck you away then was it that he took you in and strengthenedyou with his help and supplied you with good things that haply ye mightgive thanks o ye who believe deal not falsely with god and his apostle and be not falsein your engagements with your own knowledge and know that your wealth and your children are a temptation and that god with him is a glorious recompense o ye who believe if ye fear god he will make good your deliverance and willput away your sins from you and will forgive you god is of greatbounteousness and call to mind when the unbelievers plotted against thee to detain theeprisoner or to kill thee or to banish thee they plotted but god plotted and of plotters is god the best and oft as our signs were rehearsed to them they said now have we heard if we pleased we could certainly utter its like yes it is mere tales of theancients and when they said god if this be the very truth from before thee raindown stones upon us from heaven or lay on us some grievous chastisement but god chose not to chastise them while thou wast with them nor would godchastise them when they sued for pardon but because they debarred the faithful from the holy temple albeit they arenot its guardians nothing is there on their part why god should not chastisethem the godfearing only are its guardians but most of them know it not and their prayer at the house of god is no other than whistling through thefingers and clapping of the hands taste then the torment for that ye havebeen unbelievers the infidels spend their riches with intent to turn men aside from the wayof god spend it they shall then shall sighing be upon them and then shallthey be overcome and the infidels shall be gathered together into hell that god may separate the bad from the good and put the bad one upon theother and heap them all up and put them into hell these are they who shallbe lost say to the infidels if they desist from their unbelief what is now pastshall be forgiven them but if they return to it they have already beforethem the doom of the ancients fight then against them till strife be at an end and the religion be all ofit god s if they desist verily god beholdeth what they do but if they turn their back know ye that god is your protector excellentprotector excellent helper and know ye that when ye have taken any booty a fifth part belongeth togod and to the apostle and to the near of kin and to orphans and to thepoor and to the wayfarer if ye believe in god and in that which we havesent down to our servant on the day of the victory the day of the meetingof the hosts over all things is god potent when ye were encamped on the near side of the valley and they were on thefurther side and the caravan was below you if ye had made an engagement toattack ye would have failed the engagement but ye were led into actionnotwithstanding that god might accomplish the thing destined to be done that he who should perish might perish with a clear token before him andthat he who liveth might live with it and verily god heareth knoweth remember when god shewed them to thee in thy dream as few had he shown themnumerous ye would certainly have become fainthearted and would certainlyhave disputed about the matter but from this god kept you he knoweth the verysecrets of the breast and when on your meeting he made them to appear to your eyes as few anddiminished you in their eyes that god might carry out the thing that was tobe done to god do all things return believers when ye confront a troop stand firm and make frequent mention ofthe name of god that it may fare well with you and obey god and his apostle and dispute not lest ye become faintheartedand your success go from you but endure with steadfastness for god is withthe steadfastly enduring and be not like those meccans who came out of their houses insolently and tobe seen of men and who turn others from the way of god god is round abouttheir actions when satan prepared their works for them and said no man shall conquer youthis day and verily i will be near to help you but when the two armiescame in sight he turned on his heel and said ay i am clear of you ay isee what ye see not ay i fear god for god is severe in punishing when the hypocrites and the diseased of heart said their religion hathmisled the muslims but whoso putteth his trust in god yes verilygod is mighty wise if thou didst see when the angels cause the infidels to die they smitetheir faces and their backs and taste ye the torture of the burning this for what your hands have sent on before you and god is not unjust tohis servants their state is like that of the people of pharaoh and of those before themwho believed not in the signs of god therefore god seized upon them in theirsin god is mighty severe in punishing this because god changeth not the favour with which he favoureth a people so long as they change not what is in their hearts and for that god heareth knoweth their state is like that of the people of pharaoh and of those before themwho treated their lord s signs as lies we therefore destroyed them in theirsins and we drowned the people of pharaoh for they were all doers of wrong the worst beasts truly in the sight of god are the thankless who will notbelieve they with whom thou hast leagued and who are ever breaking their league andwho fear not god if thou take them in war then by the example of their fate scatter thosewho shall follow them that they may be warned or if thou fear treachery from any people throw back their treaty to them asthou fairly mayest for god loveth not the treacherous and think not that the infidels shall escape us they shall not weaken god make ready then against them what force ye can and strong squadrons wherebyye may strike terror into the enemy of god and your enemy and into othersbeside them whom ye know not but whom god knoweth all that you shall expendfor the cause of god shall be repaid you and ye shall not be wronged and if they lean to peace lean thou also to it and put thy trust in god for he is the hearing the knowing but if they seek to betray thee god will be all sufficient for thee he itis who hath strengthened thee with his help and with the faithful and hathmade their hearts one hadst thou spent all the riches of the earth thoucouldst not have united their hearts but god hath united them for he ismighty wise o prophet god and such of the faithful as follow thee will be all sufficient for thee o prophet stir up the faithful to the fight twenty of you who stand firmshall vanquish two hundred and if there be a hundred of you they shallvanquish a thousand of the infidels for they are a people devoid ofunderstanding now hath god made your work easy for he knoweth how weak ye are if there bean hundred of you who endure resolutely they shall vanquish two hundred andif there be a thousand of you they shall vanquish two thousand by god spermission for god is with those who are resolute to endure no prophet hath been enabled to take captives until he had made greatslaughter in the earth ye desire the passing fruitions of this world butgod desireth the next life for you and god is mighty wise had there not been a previous ordinance from god a severe chastisement hadbefallen you for the ransom which ye took eat therefore of the spoils ye have taken what is lawful and good and feargod god is gracious merciful o prophet say to the captives who are in your hands if god shall knowgood to be in your hearts he will give you good beyond all that hath beentaken from you and will forgive you for god is forgiving merciful but if they seek to deal treacherously with you they have already dealttreacherously with god before therefore hath he given you power over them god is knowing wise verily they who have believed and fled their homes and spent their substancefor the cause of god and they who have taken in the prophet and been helpfulto him shall be near of kin the one to the other and they who havebelieved but have not fled their homes shall have no rights of kindred withyou at all until they too fly their country yet if they seek aid from youon account of the faith your part it is to give them aid except against apeople between whom and yourselves there shall be a treaty and god beholdethyour actions the infidels lend one another mutual help unless ye do

down to muhammad for it is the truth from their lord their sinswill he cancel and dispose their hearts aright this because the infidels followed vanity while those who believe followedthe truth from their lord thus to men doth god set forth their likenesses when ye encounter the infidels strike off their heads till ye have made agreat slaughter among them and of the rest make fast the fetters and afterwards let there either be free dismissals or ransomings till thewar hath laid down its burdens thus do were such the pleasure of god hecould himself take vengeance upon them but he would rather prove the one ofyou by the other and whoso fight for the cause of god their works he willnot suffer to miscarry he will vouchsafe them guidance and dispose their hearts aright and he will bring them into the paradise of which he hath told them believers if ye help god god will help you and will set your feet firm but as for the infidels let them perish and their works shall god bring tonought this because they were averse from the command which god sent down fruitless therefore shall their works become have they not journeyed through the land and seen what hath been the end ofthose who flourished before them god brought destruction on them and thelike of this doth await the infidels this because god is the protector of those who believe and because theinfidels have no protector verily god will bring those who believe and do the things that are right into the gardens beneath whose shades the rivers flow but they who believenot take their fill and eat as the beasts eat and their dwelling place thefire and how many cities were mightier in strength than thy city which haththrust thee forth we destroyed them and there was none to help them shall he who followeth the clear teaching of his lord be as he the evil ofwhose doings hath been made to seem good to him or like those who followtheir own lusts a picture of the paradise which is promised to the god fearing therein arerivers of water which corrupt not rivers of milk whose taste changeth not and rivers of wine delicious to those who quaff it and rivers of honey clarified and therein are all kinds of fruit for themfrom their lord is this like the lot of those who must dwell for ever in thefire and shall have draughts of boiling water forced on them which will rendtheir bowels asunder some of them indeed hearken to thee until when they go out from thee theysay with sneers to those to whom the knowledge hath been given what isthis he said these are they whose hearts god hath sealed up and who followtheir own lusts but as to those who have the guidance he will increase their guidance andhe will teach them what to fear for what do the infidels wait but that the hour come suddenly on them already are its signs come and when it hath come on them indeed how canthey be warned then know then that there is no god but god and ask pardon for thy sin and forbelievers both men and women god knoweth your busy movements and yourfinal resting places the believers say oh would that a sura were sent down but when aperemptory sura is revealed whose burden is war thou mayest see thediseased of heart look toward thee with a look of one on whom the shadows ofdeath have fallen but better in them would be obedience and becominglanguage and if when the command for war is issued they are true to god it will beassuredly best for them were ye not ready if ye had turned back from him to spread disorder in theland and violate the ties of blood these are they whom god hath cursed and made deaf and blinded their eyes will they not then meditate on the koran are locks upon their hearts but as to those who return to their errors after the guidance hath beenmade plain to them satan shall beguile them and fill them with hissuggestions this because they say to those who abhor what god hath sent down we willcomply with you in part of what ye enjoin but god knoweth their secretreservations but how when the angels in causing them to die shall smite them on theface and back this because they follow that which angereth god and abhor what pleasethhim therefore will he make their works fruitless think these men of diseased hearts that god will not bring out their maliceto light if such were our pleasure we could point them out to thee and thou surelyknow them by their tokens and know them thou shalt by the strangeness oftheir words god knoweth your doings and we will surely test you until we know the valiant and the steadfastamong you and we will test the reports of your conduct verily they who believe not and turn others from the way of god andseparate from the apostle after that the guidance hath been clearly shewnthem shall in no way injure god but their works shall he bring to nought believers obey god and the apostle and render not your works vain verily those who believe not and who pervert others from the way of god andthen die in unbelief god will not forgive be not fainthearted then and invite not the infidels to peace when ye havethe upper hand for god is with you and will not defraud you of therecompense of your works surely this present life is only a play and pastime but if ye believe feargod he will give you your rewards but he will not ask all your riches ofyou should he ask them of you and urge you ye would shew yourself niggards andhe would bring your grudges to light lo ye are they who are called to expend for the cause of god and some ofyou are niggards but whoso is niggardly shall be niggard only to his ownloss for god is the rich and ye are the poor and if ye turn back he willchange you for another people and they shall not be your like this sura was revealed at a period after the victory at bedr when therewas still some hesitation on the part of muhammad s followers to take decidedsteps for securing their position see lit will he cause to wander that is from their proper aim and end therewards of paradise see verse ad f the meccans and other unbelievers of muhammad s time the hanefites supposethis law to apply only to the battle of bedr the shiites take it as ofuniversal obligation this verse is said by omar b muhammad and itq to be the expressionof muhammad s feelings at the injuries inflicted on mecca he is reported tohave wept over it the first sign being the mission of muhammad the second the splitting ofthe moon the third the smoke mentioned in sura xliv p that is commanding war against the infidels unintelligible or affected words applied to the new religion in contempt see sura xci ii p matt xxi sura iii the family of imran xcvii medina versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulelif lam mim god there is no god but he the living the merciful in truth hath he sent down to thee the book which confirmeth those whichprecede it for he had sent down the law and the evangel aforetime as man sguidance and now hath he sent down the illumination furkan verily for those who believe not in the signs of god is a severechastisement and god is mighty the avenger god nought that is in earth or that is in heaven is hidden unto him he itis who formeth you in your mothers wombs there is no god but he themighty the wise he it is who hath sent down to thee the book some of its signs are ofthemselves perspicuous these are the basis of the book and others arefigurative but they whose hearts are given to err follow its figures craving discord craving an interpretation yet none knoweth itsinterpretation but god and the stable in knowledge say we believe in it it is all from our lord but none will bear this in mind save men enduedwith understanding o our lord suffer not our hearts to go astray after that thou hast onceguided us and give us mercy from before thee for verily thou art he whogiveth o our lord for the day of whose coming there is not a doubt thou wiltsurely gather mankind together verily god will not fail the promise as for the infidels their wealth and their children shall avail themnothing against god they shall be fuel for the fire after the wont of the people of pharaoh and of those who went before them they treated our signs as falsehoods therefore god laid hold of them intheir sins and god is severe in punishing say to the infidels ye shall be worsted and to hell shall ye be gatheredtogether and wretched the couch ye have already had a sign in the meeting of the two hosts the one hostfought in the cause of god and the other was infidel to their own eyesight the infidels saw you twice as many as themselves and god aided with hissuccour whom he would and in this truly was a lesson for men endued withdiscernment fair seeming to men is the love of pleasures from women and children and thetreasured treasures of gold and silver and horses of mark and flocks andcornfields such the enjoyment of this world s life but god goodly the homewith him say shall i tell you of better things than these prepared for those whofear god in his presence theirs shall be gardens beneath whose pavilionsthe rivers flow and in which shall they abide for aye and wives ofstainless purity and acceptance with god for god regardeth his servants who say o our lord we have indeed believed pardon us our sins and keepus from the torment of the fire the patient and the truthful the lowly and the charitable and they whoseek pardon at each daybreak god witnesseth that there is no god but he and the angels and men enduedwith knowledge stablished in righteousness proclaim there is no god buthe the mighty the wise the true religion with god is islam and they to whom the scriptures had beengiven differed not till after the knowledge had come to them and throughmutual jealousy but as for him who shall not believe in the signs of god godwill be prompt to reckon with him if they shall dispute with thee then say i have surrendered myself to god as have they who follow me say to those who have received the book and to the common folk do yesurrender yourselves unto god if they become muslims then are they guidedaright but if they turn away thy duty is only preaching and god s eye is onhis servants but to those who believe not in the signs of god and unjustly slay theprophets and slay those men who enjoin uprightness announce an afflictivechastisement these are they whose works come to nought in this world and in the next andnone shall they have to help them hast thou not marked those who have received a portion of the scriptures when they are summoned to the book of god that it may settle theirdifferences then did a part of them turn back and withdrew far off this because they said the fire shall by no means touch us but for certaindays their own devices have deceived them in their religion but how when we shall assemble them together for the day of which whosecoming there is no doubt and when every soul shall be paid what it hathearned and they shall not be wronged say o god possessor of all power thou givest power to whom thou wilt andfrom whom thou wilt thou takest it away thou raisest up whom thou wilt andwhom thou wilt thou dost abase in thy hand is good for thou art over allthings potent thou causest the night to pass into the day and thou causest the day to passinto the night thou bringest the living out of the dead and thou bringestthe dead out of the living and thou givest sustenance to whom thou wilt without measure let not believers take infidels for their friends rather than believers whoso shall do this hath nothing to hope from god unless indeed ye fear afear from them but god would have you beware of himself for to god yereturn say whether ye hide what is in your breasts or whether ye publishit abroad god knoweth it he knoweth what is in the heavens and what is inthe earth and over all things is god potent on that day shall every soul find present to it whatever it hath wrought ofgood and as to what it hath wrought of evil it will wish that wide were thespace between itself and it but god would have you beware of himself forgod is kind to his servants say if ye love god then follow me god will love you and forgive yoursins for god is forgiving merciful say obey god and the apostle but ifye turn away then verily god loveth not the unbelievers verily above all human beings did god choose adam and noah and the familyof abraham and the family of imran the one the posterity of the other andgod heareth knoweth remember when the wife of imran said o my lord i vow to thee what is inmy womb for thy special service accept it from me for thou hearest knowest and when she had given birth to it she said o my lord verily ihave brought forth a female god knew what she had brought forth a male isnot as a female and i have named her mary and i take refuge with thee forher and for her offspring from satan the stoned so with goodly acceptance did her lord accept her and with goodly growth didhe make her grow zacharias reared her so oft as zacharias went in to maryat the sanctuary he found her supplied with food oh mary said he whence hast thou this she said it is from god for god supplieth whom hewill without reckoning there did zacharias call upon his lord o my lord said he vouchsafe mefrom thyself good descendants for thou art the hearer of prayer then didthe angels call to him as he stood praying in the sanctuary god announceth john yahia to thee who shall be a verifier of the wordfrom god and a great one chaste and a prophet of the number of the just he said o my lord how shall i have a son now that old age hath come uponme and my wife is barren he said thus will god do his pleasure he said lord give me a token he said thy token shall be that forthree days thou shalt speak to no man but by signs but remember thy lordoften and praise him at even and at morn and remember when the angels said o mary verily hath god chosen thee and purified thee and chosen thee above the women of the worlds o mary be devout towards thy lord and prostrate thyself and bow downwith those who bow this is one of the announcements of things unseen by thee to thee omuhammad do we reveal it for thou wast not with them when they cast lotswith reeds which of them should rear mary nor wast thou with them whenthey disputed about it remember when the angel said o mary verily god announceth to thee the wordfrom him his name shall be messiah jesus the son of mary illustrious inthis world and in the next and one of those who have near access to god and he shall speak to men alike when in the cradle and when grown up and heshall be one of the just she said how o my lord shall i have a son when man hath not touched me he said thus god will create what he will when he decreeth a thing heonly saith be and it is and he will teach him the book and the wisdom and the law and the evangel and he shall be an apostle to the children of israel now have i come hewill say to you with a sign from your lord out of clay will i make foryou as it were the figure of a bird and i will breathe into it and itshall become by god s leave a bird and i will heal the blind and theleper and by god s leave will i quicken the dead and i will tell you whatye eat and what ye store up in your houses truly in this will be a sign foryou if ye are believers and i have come to attest the law which was before me and to allow you partof that which had been forbidden you and i come to you with a sign from yourlord fear god then and obey me of a truth god is my lord and your lord therefore worship him this is a right way and when jesus perceived unbelief on their part he said who my helperswith god the apostles said we will be god s helpers we believe ingod and bear thou witness that we are muslims o our lord we believe in what thou hast sent down and we follow theapostle write us up then with those who bear witness to him and the jews plotted and god plotted but of those who plot is god the best remember when god said o jesus verily i will cause thee to die and willtake thee up to myself and deliver thee from those who believe not and iwill place those who follow thee above those who believe not until the dayof resurrection then to me is your return and wherein ye differ will idecide between you and as to those who believe not i will chastise them with a terriblechastisement in this world and in the next and none shall they have to helpthem but as to those who believe and do the things that are right he will paythem their recompense god loveth not the doers of evil these signs and this wise warning do we rehearse to thee verily jesus is as adam in the sight of god he created him of dust hethen said to him be and he was the truth from thy lord be not thou therefore of those who doubt as for those who dispute with thee about him after theknowledge hathcome to thee say come let us summon our sons and your sons our wivesand your wives and ourselves and yourselves then will we invoke and lay themalison of god on those that lie this recital is very truth and there is no god but god and verily god isthe mighty the wise but if they turn away then verily god hath knowledge of the corrupt doers say o people of the book come ye to a just judgment between us and you thatwe worship not aught but god and that we join no other god with him andthat the one of us take not the other for lords beside god then if theyturn their backs say bear ye witness that we are muslims o people of the book why dispute about abraham when the law and theevangel were not sent down till after him do ye not then understand lo ye are they who dispute about that in which ye have knowledge but whydispute ye about that of which ye have no knowledge god hath knowledge butye know nothing abraham was neither jew nor christian but he was sound in the faith amuslim and not of those who add gods to god they among men who are nearest of kin to abraham are surely those whofollow him and this prophet muhammad and they who believe on him and godis the protector of the faithful a party among the people of the book would fain mislead you but they onlymislead themselves and perceive it not o people of the book why disbelieve the signs of god of which yourselveshave been witnesses o people of the book why clothe ye the truth with falsehood why wittinglyhide the truth others of the people of the book say believe in what hath been sent down tothe believers at daybreak and deny it at its close thus do they go back and believe in those only who follow your religion say true guidance isguidance from god that to others may be imparted the like of what hath beenimparted to you will they wrangle then with you in the presence of theirlord say plenteous gifts are in the hands of god he imparteth them untowhom he will and god is bounteous wise he will vouchsafe his mercy to whom he will for god is of greatbounteousness among the people of the book are some to one of whom if thou entrust athousand dinars he will restore them to thee and there is of them to whomif thou entrust a dinar he will not restore it to thee unless thou be everinstant with him this because they say we are not bound to keep faith with the ignorant pagan folk and they utter a lie against god and know they do so but whoso is true to his engagement and feareth god verily god loveth thosethat fear him verily they who barter their engagement with god and their oaths for somepaltry price these no portion for them in the world to come and god willnot speak to them and will not look on them on the day of resurrection andwill not assoil them for them a grievous chastisement and some truly are there among them who torture the scriptures with theirtongues in order that ye may suppose it to be from the scripture yet it isnot from the scripture and they say this is from god yet it is not fromgod and they utter a lie against god and they know they do so it beseemeth not a man that god should give him the scriptures and thewisdom and the gift of prophecy and that then he should say to hisfollowers be ye worshippers of me as well as of god but rather beye perfect in things pertaining to god since ye know the scriptures andhave studied deep god doth not command you to take the angels or the prophets as lords what would he command you to become infidels after ye have been muslims when god entered into covenant with the prophets he said this is thebook and the wisdom which i give you hereafter shall a prophet came unto youto confirm the scriptures already with you ye shall surely believe on him and ye shall surely aid him are ye resolved said he and do ye accept thecovenant on these terms they said we are resolved be ye then thewitnesses said he and i will be a witness as well as you and whoever turneth back after this these are surely the perverse other religion than that of god desire they to him doth everything that isin the heavens and in the earth submit in willing or forced obedience andto him do they return say we believe in god and in what hath been sent down to us and what hathbeen sent down to abraham and ismael and isaac and jacob and the tribes and in what was given to moses and jesus and the prophets from their lord we make no difference between them and to him are we resigned muslims whoso desireth any other religion than islam that religion shall never beaccepted from him and in the next world he shall be among the lost how shall god guide a people who after they had believed and bore witnessthat the apostle was true and after that clear proofs of his mission hadreached them disbelieved god guideth not the people who transgress these their recompense that the curse of god and of angels and of allmen is on them under it shall they abide for ever their torment shall not be assuaged norshall god even look upon them save those who after this repent and amend for verily god is gracious merciful as for those who become infidels after having believed and then increasetheir infidelity their repentance shall never be accepted these they arethe erring ones as for those who are infidels and die infidels from no one of them shall asmuch gold as the earth could contain be accepted though he should offer itin ransom these a grievous punishment awaiteth them and they shall havenone to help them ye shall never attain to goodness till ye give alms of that which ye love and whatever ye give of a truth god knoweth it all food was allowed to the children of israel except what jacob forbadhimself ere the law was sent down say bring ye then the law and read it if ye be men of truth and whoso after this inventeth the lie about god these are evil doers say god speaketh truth follow therefore the religion of abraham thesound in faith who was not one of those who joined other gods to god the first temple that was founded for mankind was that in becca blessed and a guidance to human beings in it are evident signs even the standing place of abraham and he whoentereth it is safe and the pilgrimage to the temple is a service due togod from those who are able to journey thither and as to him who believeth not verily god can afford to dispense with allcreatures say o people of the book why disbelieve ye the signs of god but god iswitness of your doings say o people of the book why repel believers from the way of god ye fainwould make it crooked and yet ye are its witnesses but god is notregardless of what ye do o believers if ye obey some amongst those who have received the scripture after your very faith will they make you infidels but how can ye become infidels when the signs of god are recited to you andhis prophet is among you whoever holdeth fast by god is already guided to astraight path o ye believers fear god as he deserveth to be feared and die not till yehave become muslims and hold ye fast by the cord of god all of you and break not loose fromit and remember god s goodness towards you how that when ye were enemies he united your hearts and by his favour ye became brethren and when ye were on the brink of the pit of fire he drew you back from it thus god clearly sheweth you his signs that ye may be guided and that there may be among you a people who invite to the good and enjointhe just and forbid the wrong these are they with whom it shall be well and be ye not like those who have formed divisions and fallen to varianceafter the clear proofs have come to them these a terrible chastisement dothawait them on the day when faces shall turn white and faces shall turn black and as tothose whose faces shall have turned black what after your beliefhave ye become infidels taste then the chastisement for that ye have beenunbelievers and as to those whose faces shall have become white they shall be within themercy of god therein shall they abide for ever these are the signs of god we recite them to thee in truth and god willethnot injustice to mankind whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth is god s and togod shall all things return ye are the best folk that hath been raised up unto mankind ye enjoin thejust and ye forbid the evil and ye believe in god and if the people of thebook had believed it had surely been better for them believers there areamong them but most of them are perverse they will never inflict on you but a trifling damage and if they do battlewith you they shall turn their backs to you then they shall not besuccoured shame shall be stamped upon them wherever found unless they ally them withgod and men and the wrath of god will they incur and poverty shall bestamped upon them this for that they believed not in the signs of god andslew the prophets unjustly this because they rebelled and becametransgressors yet all are not alike among the people of the book is an upright folk whorecite the signs of god in the night season and adore they believe in god and in the latter day and enjoin justice and forbidevil and speed on in good works these are of the righteous and of whatever good ye do ye shall not be denied the meed god knoweththose who fear him but as for the infidels their wealth and their children shall avail themnothing against god they shall be the inmates of the fire to abide thereineternally the alms which they bestow in this present life are like a freezing wind which falleth upon and destroyeth the cornfields of a people who have been tothemselves unjust god doeth them no injustice but to themselves are theyunjust o ye who have believed form not intimacies among others than yourselves they will not fail to corrupt you they long for your ruin hatred hathalready shewn itself out of their mouths but more grievous is what theirbreasts conceal the tokens thereof we have already made plain to you if yewill comprehend see now ye love them but they love not you ye believe the entire book andwhen they meet you they say we believe but when they are apart theybite their fingers ends at you out of wrath say die in your wrath godtruly knoweth the very recesses of your breasts if good befalleth you it grieveth them and when ill lighteth on you theyrejoice in it but if ye be steadfast and fear god their craft shall in noway harm you for god is round about their doings and remember when thou didst leave thy household at early morn that thoumightest prepare the faithful a camp for the war god heard knew it when two troops of you became full of anxious thoughts and lost heart andwhen god became the protector of both in god then let the faithful trust god had already succoured you at bedr when ye were the weaker fear god then that ye may be thankful then thou didst say to the faithful is it not enough for you that your lordaideth you with three thousand angels sent down from on high aye but ye if be steadfast and fear god and the foe come upon you in hothaste your lord will help you with five thousand angels in theircognisances this as pure good tidings for you did god appoint that your hearts mightbe assured for only from god the mighty the wise cometh the victory andthat he might cut off the uttermost part of those who believed not or castthem down so that they should be overthrown defeated without resource it is none of thy concern whether he be turned unto them in kindness orchastise them for verily they are wrongful doers whatever is in the heavens and the earth is god s he forgiveth whom he will and whom he will chastiseth for god is forgiving merciful o ye who believe devour not usury doubling it again and again but feargod that ye may prosper and fear the fire which is prepared for them that believe not and obey godand the apostle that ye may find mercy and vie in haste for pardon from your lord and a paradise vast as theheavens and the earth prepared for the god fearing who give alms alike in prosperity and in success and who master theiranger and forgive others god loveth the doers of good they who after they have done a base deed or committed a wrong against theirown selves remember god and implore forgiveness of their sins and who willforgive sins but god only and persevere not in what they have wittingly doneamiss as for these pardon from their lord shall be their recompense and gardens neath which the rivers flow for ever shall they abide therein and goodlythe reward of those who labour already before your time have examples been made traverse the earth then and see what hath been the end of those who treat prophets as liars this koran is a manifest to man and a guidance and a warning to the god fearing and be not fainthearted and be not sorrowful for ye shall gain the upperhand if ye be believers if a wound hath befallen you a wound like it hath already befallen others we alternate these days of successes and reverses among men that god mayknow those who have believed and that he may take martyrs from among you but god loveth not the wrongful doers and that god may test those who believe and destroy the infidels thought ye that ye should enter paradise ere god had taken knowledge of thoseamong you who did valiantly and of those who steadfastly endure ye had desired death ere ye met it but ye have now seen it and ye havebeheld it and fled from it muhammad is no more than an apostle other apostles have already passed awaybefore him if he die therefore or be slain will ye turn upon yourheels but he who turneth on his heels shall not injure god at all and godwill certainly reward the thankful no one can die except by god s permission according to the book that fixeththe term of life he who desireth the recompense of this world we willgive him thereof and he who desireth the recompense of the next life wewill give him thereof and we will certainly reward the thankful how many a prophet hath combated those who had with them many myriads yetwere they not daunted at what befel them on the path of god nor were theyweakened nor did they basely submit god loveth those who endure withsteadfastness nor said they more than this o our lord forgive us our sins and ourmistakes in this our work and set our feet firm and help us against theunbelieving people and god gave them the recompense of this world and theexcellence of the recompense of the next for god loveth the doers of what isexcellent o ye who have believed if ye obey the infidels they will cause you to turnupon your heels and ye will fall back into perdition but god is your liege lord and he is the best of helpers we will cast a dread into hearts of the infidels because they have joinedgods with god without warranty sent down their abode shall be the fire andwretched shall be the mansion of the evil doers already had god made good to you his promise when by his permission yedestroyed your foes until your courage failed you and ye disputed about theorder and disobeyed after that the prophet had brought you within view ofthat for which ye longed some of you were for this world and some for the next then in order tomake trial of you he turned you to flight from them yet hath he nowforgiven you for all bounteous is god to the faithful when ye came up the height and took no heed of any one while the prophetin your rear was calling you to the fight god hath rewarded you with troubleupon trouble that ye might learn not to be chagrined at your loss of booty or at what befel you god is acquainted with your actions then after the trouble god sent down security upon you slumber fell upon apart of you as to the other part their own passions stirred them up to thinkunjustly of god with thoughts of ignorance they said what gain we by thisaffair say verily the affair resteth wholly with god they hid in theirminds what they did not speak out to thee saying were we to have gainedaught in this affair none of us had been slain at this place say had yeremained in your homes they who were decreed to be slain would have goneforth to the places where they lie in order that god might make trial ofwhat was in your breasts and might discover what was in your hearts for godknoweth the very secrets of the breast of a truth it was satan alone who caused those of you to fail in duty whoturned back on the day when the hosts met for some of their doings but nowhath god pardoned them for god is forgiving gracious o ye who believe be not like the infidels who said of their brethren whenthey had travelled by land or had gone forth to war had they kept with us they had not died and had not been slain god purposed that this affairshould cause them heart sorrow god maketh alive and killeth and godbeholdeth your actions and if ye shall be slain or die on the path of god then pardon from god andmercy is better than all your amassings for if ye die or be slain verily unto god shall ye be gathered of the mercy of god thou hast spoken to them in gentle terms hadst thou beensevere and harsh hearted they would have broken away from thee therefore forgive and ask for pardon for them and consult them in the affair of war and when thou art resolved then put thou thy trust in god for god loveththose who trust in him if god help you none shall overcome you but if he abandon you who is hethat shall help you when he is gone in god then let the faithful trust it is not the prophet who will defraud you but he who shall defraud shallcome forth with his defraudings on the day of the resurrection then shallevery soul be paid what it hath merited and they shall not be treated withinjustice shall he who hath followed the good pleasure of god be as he who hath broughton himself wrath from god and whose abode shall be hell and wretched thejourney thither there are varying grades with god and god beholdeth what ye do now hath god been gracious to the faithful when he raised up among them anapostle out of their own people to rehearse unto them his signs and tocleanse them and to give them knowledge of the book and of wisdom forbefore they were in manifest error when a reverse hath befallen you the like of which ye had beforeinflicted say ye whence is this say it is from yourselves for god hathpower over all things and that which befel you on the day when the armies met was certainly by thewill of god and that he might know the faithful and that he might know thehypocrites and when the word was advance fight on the path of god ordrive back the foe they said had we known how to fight we would havefollowed you nearer were some of them on that day to unbelief than tofaith they said with their lips what was not in their hearts but god knew whatthey concealed who said of their brethren while themselves sat at home had they obeyed us they had not been slain say keep back death fromyourselves if ye speak truth and repute not those slain on god s path to be dead nay alive with theirlord are they richly sustained rejoicing in what god of his bounty hath vouchsafed them filled with joy forthose who follow after them but have not yet overtaken them that on themnor fear shall come nor grief filled with joy at the favours of god and at his bounty and that godsuffereth not the reward of the faithful to perish as to those who after the reverse which befel them respond to god and theapostle such of them as do good works and fear god shall have a greatreward who when men said to them now are the meccans mustering against you therefore fear them it only increased their faith and they said oursufficiency is god and he is an excellent protector they returned therefore with the favour of god enriched by him anduntouched by harm and they followed what was well pleasing to god and godis of great munificence only would that satan instil the fear of his adherents fear them not butfear me if ye are believers let not those who vie in haste after infidelity grieve thee verily not onewhit shall they injure god god will refuse them all part in the life tocome a severe

they have sold it suppose not that they who rejoice in what they have brought to pass and loveto be praised for what they have not done suppose not they shall escape thechastisement an afflictive

elizabeth to be sisters who with jesus john and zacharias make up the family of imran it is difficult to avoidthe conclusion that muhammad is guilty of the anachronism of confoundingmiriam with the virgin mary on the other hand is the difficulty ofconceiving that as the sequence of time and fact is observed with tolerableaccuracy in regard to the main features of jewish and christian history heshould have fallen into so serious an error or have so inadvertentlyadopted as mr muir supposes the phraseology of his jewish informants amongst whom the only well known mary miriam was the daughter of imran andthe sister of moses as to have overlooked the discrepancy in theirrespective dates but it is possible that muhammad believed as some muslimwriters assert that miriam s soul and body were

things ofyour own for their valuable ones and devour not their property after addingit to your own for this is a great crime and if ye are apprehensive that ye shall not deal fairly with orphans then of other women who seem good in your eyes marry but two or three or four and if ye still fear that ye shall not act equitably then one only or theslaves whom ye have acquired this will make justice on your part easier give women their dowry freely but if of themselves they give up aughtthereof to you then enjoy it as convenient and profitable and entrust not to the incapable the substance which god hath placed with youfor their support but maintain them therewith and clothe them and speak tothem with kindly speech and make trial of orphans until they reach the age of marriage and if yeperceive in them a sound judgment then hand over their substance to them but consume ye it not wastefully or by hastily entrusting it to them because they are growing up and let the rich guardian not even touch it andlet him who is poor use it for his support eat of it with discretion and when ye make over their substance to them then take witnesses in theirpresence god also maketh a sufficient account men ought to have a part of what their parents and kindred leave and womena part of what their parents and kindred leave whether it be little or much let them have a stated portion and when they who are of kin are present at the division and the orphans andthe poor let them too have a share and speak to them with kindly speech and let those be afraid to wrong the orphans who should they leave

in order to take from them part ofthe dowry you had given them unless they have been guilty of undoubtedlewdness but associate kindly with them for if ye are estranged from them haply ye are estranged from that in which god hath placed abundant good and if ye be desirous to exchange one wife for another and have given one ofthem a talent make no deduction from it would ye take it by slandering her and with manifest wrong how moreover could ye take it when one of you hath gone in unto the other and they have received from you a strict bond of union and marry not women whom your fathers have married for this is a shame andhateful and an evil way though what is past may be allowed forbidden to you are your mothers and your daughters and your sisters andyour aunts both on the father and

besidethis to seek out wives by means of your wealth with modest conduct andwithout fornication and give those with whom ye have cohabited their dowry this is the law but it shall be no crime in you to make agreements over andabove the law verily god is knowing wise and whoever of you is not rich enough to marry free believing women then lethim marry such of your believing maidens as have fallen into your hands asslaves god well knoweth your faith ye are sprung the one from the other marry them then with the leave of their masters and give them a fairdower but let them be chaste and free from fornication and not entertainersof lovers if after marriage they commit adultery then inflict upon them half thepenalty enacted for free married women this law is for him among you who isafraid of doing wrong but if ye abstain it will be better for you andgod is lenient merciful god desireth to make this known to you and to guide you into the ways ofthose who have been before you and to turn

light for man hath been created weak o believers devour not each other s substance in mutual frivolities unlessthere be a trafficking among you by your own consent and commit notsuicide of a truth god is merciful to you and whoever shall do this maliciously and wrongfully we will in the end casthim into the fire for this is easy with god if ye avoid the great sins which ye are forbidden we will blot out yourfaults and we will cause you to enter paradise with honourable entry covet not the gifts by which god hath raised some of you above others themen shall have a portion according to their deserts and the women a portionaccording to their deserts of god therefore ask his gifts verily godhath knowledge of all things to every one have we appointed kindred as heirs of what parents

bestow alms out of what god hath vouchsafed them for godtaketh knowledge of them god truly will not wrong any one of the weight of a mote and if there be anygood deed he will repay it doubly and from his presence shall be given agreat recompense how when we shall bring up against them witnesses from all peoples and whenwe shall bring thee up as witness against these on that day they who

of adate stone behold how they devise a lie of god therein is wickedness manifest enough hast thou not observed those to whom a part of the scriptures hath beengiven they believe in djibt and thagout and say of the infidels theseare guided in a batter path than those who hold the faith these are they whom god hath cursed and for him whom god hath cursed thoushalt by on means find a helper shall they have a share in the kingdom who would not bestow on their fellowmen even the speck in a date stone envy they other men what god of his bounty hath given them we gave of oldthe scriptures and wisdom to the line of abraham and we gave them a grandkingdom some of them believe on the prophet and some turn aside from him the flameof hell is their sufficing punishment those who disbelieve our signs we will in the end cast into the fire so oftas their skins shall be well burnt we will change them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment verily god is mighty wise but as for those who have believed and done the things that are right wewill bring being them into gardens neath which the rivers flow therein toabide eternally therein shall they have wives of stainless purity and wewill bring them into aye shadowing shades verily god enjoineth you to give back your trusts to their owners and whenye judge between men to judge with fairness excellent is the practice towhich god exhorteth you god heareth beholdeth o ye who believe obey god and obey the apostle and those among you investedwith authority and if in aught ye differ bring it before god and theapostle if ye believe in god and in the latter day this is the best andfairest way of settlement hast thou not marked those who profess that they believe in what hath beensent down to thee and what hath been sent down before thee fain would theybe judged before thagout though commanded not to believe in him and fainwould satan make them wander with wanderings wide of truth and when it is said to them accede to that which god hath sent down and tothe apostle thou seest the hypocrites avert them from thee with utteraversion but how when some misfortune shall fortune them for their previoushandywork then will they come to thee swearing by god we desire nothingbut to promote good and concord these are they whose hearts god knoweth therefore break off from them andwarn them speak words that may penetrate their souls we have not sent any apostle but to be obeyed it god so will but if they after they have sinned to their own hurt by unbelief come to thee and askpardon of god and the apostle ask pardon for them they shall surely findthat god is he who turneth unto man merciful and they will not i swear by thy lord they will not believe until they haveset thee up as judge between them on points where they differ then shallthey not find in their own minds any difficulty in thy decisions and shallsubmit with entire submission had we laid down such a law for them as kill yourselves or abandon yourdwellings but few of them would have done it but had they done that towhich they were exhorted better and it been for them and stronger for theconfirmation of their faith in that case we had surely given them from ourself a great recompense and onthe straight path should we surely have guided them and whoever shall obey god and the apostle these shall be with those of theprophets and of the sincere and of the martyrs and of the just to whomgod hath been gracious these are a goodly band this is the bounty of god and in knowledge doth god suffice o ye who believe make use of precautions and advance in detachments or advance in a body there is of you who will be a laggard and if a reverse befall you he saith now hath god dealt graciously with me since i was not with you in thefight but if a success from god betide you he will say as if there had never beenany friendship between you and him would i had been with them a rich prizeshould i have won let those then fight on the path of god who barter this present life forthat which is to come for whoever fighteth on god s path whether he beslain or conquer we will in the end give him a great reward but what hath come to you that ye fight not on the path of god and for theweak among men women and children who say o our lord bring us forth fromthis city whose inhabitants are oppressors give us a champion from thypresence and give us from thy presence a defender they who believe fight on the path of god and they who believe not fighton the path of thagout fight therefore against the friends of satan verilycraft of satan shall be powerless hast thou not marked those to whom it was said withhold your hands awhilefrom war and observe prayer and pay the stated alms but when war iscommanded them lo a portion of them fear men as with the fear of god orwith a yet greater fear and say o our lord why hast thou commanded uswar couldst thou not have given us respite till our not distant end say small the fruition of this world but the next life is the true good for himwho feareth god and ye shall not be wronged so much as the skin of a datestone wherever ye be death will overtake you although ye be in lofty towers ifgood fortune betide them they say this is from god and if evil betidethem they say this is from thee say all is from god but what hath cometo these people that they are not near to understanding what is told them whatever good betideth thee is from god and whatever betideth thee of evilis from thyself and we have sent thee to mankind as an apostle god is thysufficing witness whoso obeyeth the apostle in so doing obeyeth god and as to those who turnback from thee we have not sent thee to be their keeper moreover they say obedience but when they come forth from thy presence a party of them brood by night over other than thy words but god writethdown what they brood over therefore separate thyself from them and put thouthy trust in god is a sufficient protector can they not consider the koran were it from any other than god they wouldsurely have found in it many contradictions and when tidings either of security or alarm reach them they tell themabroad but if they would report them to the apostle and to those who are inauthority among them those who desire information would learn it from them but for the goodness and mercy of god towards you ye would have followedsatan except a few fight therefore on god s path lay not burdens on any but thyself and stirup the faithful the might of the infidels haply will god restrain for godis the stronger in prowess and the stronger to punish he who shall mediate between men for a good purpose shall be the gainer byit but he who shall mediate with an evil mediation shall reap the fruit ofit and god keepeth watch over everything if ye are greeted with a greeting then greet ye with a better greeting orat least return it god taketh count of all things god there is no god but he he will certainly assemble you on the day ofresurrection there is no doubt of it and whose word is more true thangod s why are ye two parties on the subject of the hypocrites when god hath castthem off for their doings desire ye to guide those whom god hath led astray but for him whom god leadeth astray thou shalt by no means find a pathway they desire that ye should be infidels as they are infidels and that yeshould be alike take therefore none of them for friends till they have fledtheir homes for the cause of god if they turn back then seize them andslay them wherever ye find them but take none of them as friends or helpers except those who shall seek and asylum among your allies and those who comeover to you their hearts forbidding them to make war on you or to make waron their own people had god pleased he would have given them power againstyou and they would have made war upon you but if they depart from you andmake not war against you and offer you peace the god alloweth you nooccasion against them ye will find others who seek to gain your confidence as well as that of theirown people so oft as they return to sedition they shall be overthrown init but if they leave you not nor propose terms or peace to you nor withholdtheir hands then seize them and slay them wherever ye find them overthese have we given you undoubted power a believer killeth not a believer but by mischance and whoso killeth abeliever by mischance shall be bound to free a believer from slavery and theblood money shall be paid to the family of the slain unless they convert itinto alms but if the slain believer be of a hostile people then let himconfer freedom on a slave who is a believer and if he be of a people betweenwhom and yourselves there is an alliance then let the blood money be paid tohis family and let him set free a slave who is a believer and let him whohath not the means fast two consecutive months this is the penance enjoinedby god and god is knowing wise but whoever shall kill a believer of set purpose his recompense shall behell for ever shall he abide in it god shall be wrathful with him andshall curse him and shall get ready for him a great torment o believers when ye go forth to the fight for the cause of god bediscerning and say not to every one who meeteth you with a greeting thouart not a believer in your greed after the chance good things of thispresent life with god are abundant spoils such hath been your wont in timespast but god hath been gracious to you be discerning then for god wellknoweth what ye do those believers who sit at home free from trouble and those who do valiantlyin the cause of god with their substance and their persons shall not betreated alike god hath assigned to those who contend earnestly with theirpersons and with their substance a rank above those who sit at home goodlypromises hath he made to all but god hath assigned to the strenuous a richrecompense above those who sit still at home rank of his own bestowal and forgiveness and mercy for god is indulgent merciful the angels when they took the souls of those who had been unjust to theirown weal demanded what hath been your state they said we were theweak ones of the earth they replied was not god s earth broad enoughfor you to flee away in these their home shall be hell and evil thepassage to it except the men and women and children who were not able through theirweakness to find the means of escape and were not guided on their way these haply god will forgive for god is forgiving gracious whoever flieth his country for the cause of god will find in the earth manyunder like compulsion and abundant resources and if any one shall quit hishome and fly to god and his apostle and then death overtake him his rewardfrom god is sure for god is gracious merciful and when ye go forth to war in the land it shall be no crime in you to cutshort your prayers if ye fear lest the infidels come upon you verily theinfidels are your undoubted enemies and when thou o apostle shalt be among them and shalt pray with them thenlet a party of them rise up with thee but let them take their arms and whenthey shall have made their prostrations let them retire to your rear thenlet another party that hath not prayed come forward and let them pray withyou but let them take their precautions and their arms pleased would theinfidels be for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they mightturn upon you at once and it shall be no crime in you to lay down your armsif rain annoy you or if ye be sick but take your precautions verily godhath made ready a shameful torment for the infidels and when ye shall have ended the prayer make mention of god standing andsitting and reclining and as soon as ye are secure observe prayer for tothe faithful prayer is a prescribed duty and for stated hours slacken not in pursuit of the foe if ye suffer assuredly they suffer alsoas ye suffer but ye hope from god for what they cannot hope and god isknowing wise verily we have sent down the book to thee with the truth thou that mayestjudge between men according as god hath given thee insight but with thedeceitful ones dispute not and implore pardon of god verily god isforgiving merciful and plead not with us for those who are self deceivers for god loveth nothim who is deceitful criminal from men they hide themselves but they cannot hide themselves from god andwhen they hold nightly discourses which please him not he is with them godis round about their doings oh ye are they who plead in their favour in this present life but who shallplead with god for them on the day of the resurrection who will be theguardian over them yet he who doth evil or shall have acted against his own weal and thenshall ask pardon of god will find god forgiving merciful and whoever committeth a crime committeth it to his own hurt and god isknowing wise and whoever committeth an involuntary fault or a crime and then layeth it onthe innocent shall surely bear the guilt of calumny and of a manifest crime but for the grace and mercy of god upon thee a party among them had resolvedto mislead thee but they shall only mislead themselves nor in aught shallthey harm thee god hath caused the book and the wisdom to descend upon thee and what thou knowest not he hath caused thee to know and the grace of godtoward thee hath been great in most of their secret talk is nothing good but only in his who enjoinethalmsgiving or that which is right or concord among men whoso doth this out of desire to please god we will give him at the last a great reward but whoso shall sever himself from the prophet after that the guidance hathbeen manifested to him and shall follow any other path than that of thefaithful we will turn our back on him as he hath turned his back on us andwe will cast him into hell an evil journey thither god truly will not forgive the joining other gods with himself other sins hewill forgive to whom he will but he who joineth gods with god hath erredwith far gone error they call beside him upon mere goddesses they invoke a rebel satan on them is the malison of god for he said a portion of thy servants will isurely take and will lead them astray and will stir desires within them and will command them and they shall cut the ears of animals and i willcommand them and they shall alter the creation of god he who takethsatan rather than god for his patron is ruined with palpable ruin he hath made them promises and he hath stirred desires within them butsatan promiseth only to beguile these their dwelling hell no escape shall they find from it but they who believe and do the things that are right we will bring theminto gardens beneath which the rivers flow for ever shall they abidetherein truly it is the promise of god and whose word is more sure thangod s not according to your wishes or the wishes of the people of the book shallthese things be he who doth evil shall be recompensed for it patron orhelper beside god shall he find none but whoso doth the things that are right whether male or female and he orshe a believer these shall enter paradise nor shall they be wronged theskin of a date stone and who hath a better religion than he who resigneth himself to god who dothwhat is good and followeth the faith of abraham in all sincerity and godtook abraham for his friend all that is in the heavens and all that is on the earth is god s and godencompasseth all things moreover they will consult thee in regard to women say god hath instructedyou about them and his will is rehearsed to you in the book concerningfemale orphans to whom ye give not their legal due and whom ye refuse tomarry also with regard to weak children and that ye deal with fairnesstowards orphans ye cannot do a good action but verily god knoweth it and if a wife fear ill usage or aversion on the part of her husband thenshall it be no fault in them if they can agree with mutual agreement foragreement is best men s souls are prone to avarice but if ye act kindly andfear god then verily your actions are not unnoticed by god and ye will not have it at all in your power to treat your wives alike eventhough you fain would do so but yield not wholly to disinclination so thatye leave one of them as it were in suspense if ye come to an understanding and fear god then verily god is forgiving merciful but if they separate god can compensate both out of his abundance for godis vast wise and whatever is in the heavens and in the earth is god s we have alreadyenjoined those to whom the scriptures were given before you and yourselves to fear god but if ye become unbelievers yet know that whatever is in theheavens and in the earth is god s and god is rich praiseworthy all that is in heaven and all that is in earth is god s god is a sufficientprotector if he pleased he could cause you to pass away o mankind and create othersin your stead for this hath god power if any one desire the reward of this world yet with god is the reward ofthis world and of the next and god heareth beholdeth o ye who believe stand fast to justice when ye bear witness before god though it be against yourselves or your parents or your kindred whetherthe party be rich or poor god is nearer than you to both therefore follownot passion lest ye swerve from truth and if ye wrest your testimony orstand aloof god verily is well aware of what ye do o ye who believe believe in god and his apostle and the book which he hathsent down to his apostle and the book which he hath sent down aforetime whoever believeth not on god and his angels and his books and his apostles and in the last day he verily hath erred with far gone error verily they who believed then became unbelievers then believed and againbecame unbelievers and then increased their unbelief it is not god who willforgive them or guide them into the way announce to the hypocrites that a dolorous torment doth await them those who take the unbelievers for friends besides the faithful do they seekhonour at their hands verily all honour belongeth unto god and already hath he sent this down to you in the book when ye shall hearthe signs of god they shall not be believed but shall be mocked at sit yenot therefore with such until they engage in other discourse otherwise yewill become like them verily god will gather the hypocrites and the infidelsall together in hell they watch you narrowly then if god grant you a victory they say are wenot with you and if the infidels meet with a success they say to them were we not superior to you and did we not defend you from thosebelievers god shall judge betwixt ye on the day of the resurrection andgod will by no means make a way for the infidels over the believers the hypocrites would deceive god but he will deceive them when they standup for prayer they stand carelessly to be seen of men and they remembergod but little wavering between the one and the other belonging neither to these nor those and by no means shalt thou find a path for him whom god misleadeth o believers take not infidels for friends rather than believers would yefurnish god with clear right to punish you verily the hypocrites shall be in the lowest abyss of the fire and by nomeans shalt thou find a helper for them save for those who turn and amend and lay fast hold on god and approve thesincerity of their religion to god these shall be numbered with thefaithful and god will at last bestow on the faithful a great reward why should god inflict a chastisement upon you if ye are grateful andbelieve god is grateful wise god loveth not that evil be matter of public talk unless any one hath beenwronged god it is who heareth knoweth whether ye publish what is good or conceal it or pardon evil verily god ispardoning powerful of a truth they who believe not on god and his apostles and seek to separategod from his apostles and say some we believe and some we believe not and desire to take a middle way these they are veritable infidels and for the infidels have we prepared ashameful punishment and they who believe on god and his apostles and make no difference betweenthem these we will bestow on them their reward at last god is gracious merciful the people of the book will ask of thee to cause a book to come down untothem out of heaven but a greater thing than this did they ask of moses forthey said shew us god plainly and for this their wickedness did the fire storm lay hold on them then took they the calf as the object of theirworship after that our clear tokens had come to them but we forgave themthis and conferred on moses undoubted power and we uplifted the mountain over them when we made a covenant with them and we said to them enter the gate adoring and we said to them transgress not on the sabbath and we received from them a strict covenant so for that they have broken their covenant and have rejected the signs ofgod and have put the prophets to death unjustly saying the while ourhearts are uncircumcised nay but god hath sealed them up for theirunbelief so that but few believe and for their unbelief and for their having spoken against mary a grievouscalumny and for their saying verily we have slain the messiah jesus the son ofmary an apostle of god yet they slew him not and they crucified him not but they had only his likeness and they who differed about him were indoubt concerning him no sure knowledge had they about him but followed onlyan opinion and they did not really slay him but god took him up to himself and god is mighty wise there shall not be one of the people of the book but shall believe in himbefore his death and in the day of resurrection he will be a witnessagainst them for the wickedness of certain jews and because they turn many from the wayof god we have forbidden them goodly viands which had been before allowedthem and because they have taken usury though they were forbidden it and havedevoured men s substance in frivolity we have got ready for the infidelsamong them a grievous torment but their men of solid knowledge and the believers who believe in that whichhath been sent down to thee and in what hath been sent down before thee andwho observe prayer and pay the alms of obligation and believe in god andthe latter day these we will give them a great reward verily we have revealed to thee as we revealed to noah and the prophets afterhim and as we revealed to abraham and ismaël and isaac and jacob and thetribes and jesus and job and jonah and aaron and solomon and to davidgave we psalms of some apostles we have told thee before of other apostles we have not toldthee and discoursing did god discourse with moses apostles charged to announce and to warn that men after those apostles might have no plea against god and god is mighty wise but god is himself witness of what he hath sent down to thee in hisknowledge hath he sent it down to thee the angels are also its witnesses but god is a sufficient witness verily they who believe not and pervert from the way of god have indeederred with error wide of truth verily those who believe not and act wrongfully god will never pardon andnever will he guide them on path than the path to hell in which they shall abide for ever and this is easyfor god o men now hath an apostle come to you with truth from your lord believethen it will be better for you but if ye believe not then all that is inthe heavens and the earth is god s and god is knowing wise o ye people of the book overstep not bounds in your religion and of god speak only truth the messiah jesus son of mary is only an apostle of god and his word which he conveyed into mary and a spirit proceeding fromhimself believe therefore in god and his apostles and say not three there is a trinity forbear it will be better for you god is only one god far be it from his glory that he should have a son his whatever is in theheavens and whatever is in the earth and god is a sufficient guardian the messiah disdaineth not to be a servant of god nor do the angels who arenigh unto him and whoso disdaineth his service and is filled with pride god will gatherthem all to himself and to those who believe and do the things that are right will he pay themtheir due recompense and out of his bounty will he increase them but as forthose who are disdainful and proud with a grievous chastisement will hechastise them and none beside god shall they find to protect or to help them o men now hath a proof come to you from your lord and we have sent down toyou a clear light as to those who believe in god and lay fast hold on him these will he cause to enter into his mercy and grace and along the straightway unto himself will he guide them they will consult thee say god instructeth you as to distant kindred if aman die childless but have a sister half what he shall have shall be her s and if she die childless he shall be her heir but if there be two sisters two third parts of what he shall have shall be theirs and if there be bothbrothers and sisters the male shall have the portion of two females godteacheth you plainly that ye err not god knoweth all things most of the events alluded to in this sura fall between the end

withmuhammad and in the month rab of the fourth year of the hejira werebesieged by him and driven first to the jews of kainoka who had emigratedpreviously under compulsion after the battle of bedr and subsequently outof arabia weil life of m p n on which account these spoils were entirely assigned to muhammad and notdivided in the usual manner see sura xcv viii weil p to the jews of the tribe of nadhir the idolaters slain at bedr djal or the jews of kainoka who had beenplundered previously to those of nadhir lit i am clear of thee this may be derived from the rabbinical idea that mount sinai was chosen on account of its lowness to be the scene of the revelation to moses inorder to shew that god loves the humble sura xxxiii the confederates ciii medina versesin the name of god the compassionate the mercifulo prophet fear thou god and obey not the unbelievers and the hypocrites truly god is knowing wise but follow what is revealed to thee from thy lord cognisant truly is he ofall your actions and put thou thy trust in god for a sufficient guardian is god god hath not given a man two hearts within him neither hath he made yourwives whom ye divorce to be as your mothers nor hath he made your adoptedsons to be as your own sons such words are indeed in your mouths but godspeaketh the truth and in the right way he guideth name them after their fathers this will be more right before god but if yeknow not who their fathers are then let them be your brethren in the faith and your comrades and unless made with intent of heart mistakes in thismatter shall be no crime in you for god is lenient merciful nearer of kin to the faithful is the prophet than they are to their ownselves his wives are their mothers according to the book of god they whoare related by blood are nearer the one to the other than other believers and than those who have fled their country for the cause of god butwhatever kindness ye shew to your kindred shall be noted down in the book and remember that we have entered into covenant with the prophets and withthee and with noah and abraham and moses and jesus son of mary and weformed with them a strict covenant that god may question the men of truth as to their truth but a sore tormenthath he prepared for the unbelievers o believers remember the goodness of god towards you when the armies cameagainst you and we sent against them a blast and hosts that ye saw not forthe eye of god was upon your doings when they assailed you from above you and from below you and when youreyes became distracted and your hearts came up into your throat and yethought divers thoughts of god then were the faithful tried and with strong quaking did they quake and when the disaffected and the diseased of heart said god and hisapostle have made us but a cheating promise and when a party of them said o people of yathrib there is no place ofsafety for you here therefore return into the city and another party ofyou asked the prophet s leave to return saying our houses are leftdefenceless no they were not left defenceless but their sole thought wasto flee away if the enemy had effected an entry at all points and they the disaffected had been asked to promote confusion they would have done so but only ashort time would they have remained in it medina they had before pledged themselves to god that they would not turn theirbacks and a pledge given to god must be enquired of say flight shall not profit you if ye have fled the death or the slaughter yet even then but a little while shall ye enjoy your good things say who is he that will screen you from god whether he choose to bring evilon you or to shew you mercy none beside god shall they find to be theirpatron or helper god well knoweth those among you who cause hindrances and those who say totheir brethren come hither to us and who come not to the fight except alittle it is out of covetousness in your regard for when an alarm cometh thoumayest see them look to thee and roll their eyes like him on whom theshadows of death have fallen yet when the alarm is passed with sharptongues will they assail you covetous of the best of the spoil no faithhave these god will make their doings of no avail and easy is this withgod they thought that the confederates would never retire and were theconfederates to come again they would fain be dwelling among the arabs ofthe desert and there ask news about you for though they were with you theyfought not except a little a noble pattern had ye in god s apostle for all who hope in god and in thelatter day and oft remember god and when the faithful saw the confederates they said this is what god andhis apostle promised us and god and his apostle spoke truly and it onlyincreased their faith and self devotion some were there among the faithful who made good what they had promised togod some have fulfilled their course and others await its fulfilment andhave not been changelings who change that god may reward the faithful for their faithfulness and may punish thehypocrites if he so please or be turned unto them for god is forgiving merciful and god drove back the infidels in their wrath they won no advantage godsufficed the faithful in the fight for god is strong mighty and he caused those of the people of the book the jews who had aided theconfederates to come down out of their fortresses and cast dismay intotheir hearts some ye slew others ye took prisoners and he gave you their land and their dwellings and their wealth for anheritage even a land on which ye had never set foot for the might of god isequal to all things o prophet say to thy wives if ye desire this present life and itsbraveries come then i will provide for you and dismiss you with anhonourable dismissal but if ye desire god and his apostle and a home in the next life then truly hath god prepared for those of you who are virtuous a great reward o wives of the prophet should any of you be guilty of a proven lewdness doubly shall her chastisement be doubled and with god this is easy but whoever of you shall obey god and his apostle and shall do that which isright twice over will we give her her reward and we have prepared for her anoble provision o wives of the prophet ye are not as other women if ye fear god be not toocomplaisant of speech lest the man of unhealthy heart should lust after you but speak with discreet speech and abide still in your houses and go not in public decked as in the days ofyour former ignorance but observe prayer and pay the impost and obey godand the apostle for god only desireth to put away filthiness from you ashis household and with cleansing to cleanse you and recollect what is rehearsed to you in your houses of the book of god andof wisdom for god is keen sighted cognisant of all truly the men who resign themselves to god muslims and the women whoresign themselves and the believing men and the believing women and thedevout men and the devout women and the men of truth and the women oftruth and the patient men and the patient women and the humble men and thehumble women and the men who give alms and the women who give alms and themen who fast and the women who fast and the chaste men and the chaste women and the men and the women who oft remember god for them hath god preparedforgiveness and a rich recompense and it is not for a believer man or woman to have any choice in theiraffairs when god and his apostle have decreed a matter and whoeverdisobeyeth god and his apostle erreth with palpable error and remember when thou saidst to him unto whom god had shewn favour andto whom thou also hadst shewn favour keep thy wife to thyself and feargod and thou didst hide in thy mind what god would bring to light andthou didst fear man but more right had it been to fear god and when zaidhad settled concerning her to divorce her we married her to thee that itmight not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wives of their adoptedsons when they have settled the affair concerning them and the behest ofgod is to be performed no blame attacheth to the prophet where god hath given him a permission suchwas the way of god with those prophets who flourished before thee for god sbehest is a fixed decree who fulfilled the mission with which god had charged them and feared him and feared none but god and god taketh a sufficient account muhammad is not the father of any man among you but he is the apostle ofgod and the seal of the prophets and god knoweth all things o believers remember god with frequent remembrance and praise him morningand evening he blesseth you and his angels intercede for you that he may bring youforth out of darkness into light and merciful is he to the believers their greeting on the day when they shall meet him shall be peace and hehath got ready for them a noble recompense o prophet we have sent thee to be a witness and a herald of glad tidings and a warner and one who through his own permission summoneth to god and a light givingtorch announce therefore to believers that great boons do await them from god and obey not the infidels and hypocrites yet abstain from injuring them andput thou thy trust in god for god is a sufficient guardian o believers when ye marry believing women and then divorce them before yehave consummated the marriage ye have no term prescribed you which ye mustfulfil towards them provide for them and dismiss them with a reputabledismissal o prophet we allow thee thy wives whom thou hast dowered and the slaveswhom thy right hand possesseth out of the booty which god hath granted thee and the daughters of thy uncle and of thy paternal and maternal aunts whofled with thee to medina and any believing woman who hath given herself upto the prophet if the prophet desired to wed her a privilege for thee abovethe rest of the faithful we well know what we have settled for them in regard to their wives and tothe slaves whom their right hands hold that there may be no fault on thypart and god is indulgent merciful thou mayst decline for the present whom thou wilt of them and thou mayesttake to thy bed her whom thou wilt and whomsoever thou shalt long for ofthose thou shalt have before neglected and this shall not be a crime inthee thus will it be easier to give them the desire of their eyes and notto put them to grief and to satisfy them with what thou shalt accord to eachof them god knoweth what is in your hearts and god is knowing gracious it is not permitted thee to take other wives hereafter nor to change thypresent wives for other women though their beauty charm thee except slaveswhom thy right hand shall possess and god watcheth all things o believers enter not into the houses of the prophet save by his leave for a meal without waiting his time when ye are invited then enter andwhen ye have eaten then disperse at once and engage not in familiar talk for this would cause the prophet trouble and he would be ashamed to bid yougo but god is not ashamed to say the truth and when ye would ask any giftof his wives ask it from behind a veil purer will this be for your heartsand for their hearts and ye must not trouble the apostle of god nor marryhis wives after him for ever this would be a grave offence with god whether ye bring a matter to the light or hide it god truly hath knowledgeof all things no blame shall attach to them your wives for speaking to their fathersunveiled or to their sons or to their brothers or to their brothers sons or to their sisters sons or to their women or to the slaves whom theirright hands hold and fear ye god for god witnesseth all things verily god and his angels bless the prophet bless ye him o believers andsalute him with salutations of peace verily they who affront god and his apostle the curse of god is on them inthis world and in the world to come and he hath prepared for them ashameful chastisement and they who shall affront believing men and believing women for no fault oftheirs they shall surely bear the guilt of slander and of a clear wrong o prophet speak to thy wives and to thy daughters and to the wives of thefaithful that they let their veils fall low thus will they more easily beknown and they will not be affronted god is indulgent merciful if the hypocrites and the men of tainted heart and the stirrers of seditionin medina desist not we will surely stir thee up against them then shallthey not be suffered to dwell near thee therein but a little while cursed wherever they are found they shall be seized and slain withslaughter such hath been the way of god with those who lived before them and no changecanst thou find in the way of god men will ask thee of the hour say the knowledge of it is with god alone and who can tell thee whether haply the hour be not nigh at hand verily god hath cursed the infidels and hath got ready for them the flame for aye shall they abide therein none to befriend them no helper shall theyfind on the day when their faces shall be rolled in the fire they shall cry oh would that we had obeyed god and obeyed the apostle and they shall say oh our lord indeed we obeyed our chiefs and our greatones and they misled us from the way of god o our lord give them a double chastisement and curse them with a heavycurse o believers be not like those who affronted moses but god cleared himfrom what they said of him and of god was he highly esteemed o believers fear god and speak with well guided speech that god may bless your doings for you and forgive you your sins and whosoobeyeth god and his apostle with great bliss shall be blessed verily we proposed to the heavens and to the earth and to the mountains toreceive the faith but they refused the burden and they feared to receiveit man undertook to bear it but hath proved unjust senseless therefore will god punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women and the men and the women who join gods with god but to the believing menand women will god turn him for god

sanctioned clear signs have we sent downtherein that ye may take warning the whore and the whoremonger scourge each of them with an hundred stripes and let not compassion keep you from carrying out the sentence of god if yebelieve in god and the last day and let some of the faithful witness theirchastisement the whoremonger shall not marry other than a whore or an idolatress and thewhore shall not marry other than a whoremonger or an idolater such alliancesare forbidden to the faithful they who defame virtuous women and bring not four witnesses scourge themwith fourscore stripes and receive ye not their testimony for ever forthese are perverse persons save those who afterwards repent and live virtuously for truly god islenient merciful and they who shall accuse their wives and have no witnesses but themselves the testimony of each of them shall be a testimony by god four timesrepeated that he is indeed of them that speak the truth and the fifth time that the malison of god be upon him if he be of them thatlie but it shall avert the chastisement from her if she testify a testimony fourtimes repeated by god that he is of them that lie and a fifth time to call down the wrath of

butregard it not as an evil to you no it is an advantage to you to every manamong them shall it be done according to the offence he hath committed andas to that person among them who took on himself to aggravate it a sorepunishment doth await him did not the faithful of both sexes when ye heard of this form a favourablejudgment in their own minds and say this is a manifest lie have they brought four witnesses of the fact if they cannot produce thewitnesses they are the liars in the sight of god and but for the goodness of god towards you and his mercy in this world andin the next a severe punishment had come upon you for that which ye spreadabroad when ye uttered with your tongues and spake with your mouths that ofwhich ye had no knowledge ye deemed it to be a light matter but with god itwas a grave one and did ye say when ye heard it it is not for us to talk of this affair ogod by thy glory this is a gross calumny god hath warned you that ye go not back to the like of this for ever if yebe believers and god maketh his signs clear to you for god is knowing wise but as for those who love that foul calumnies should go forth against thosewho believe a grievous chastisement awaits themin this world and in the next and god hath knowledge but ye have not and but for the goodness of god towards you and his mercy and that god iskind merciful o ye who believe follow not the steps of satan for whosoever shall followthe steps of satan he will enjoin on him what is base and blameworthy andbut for the goodness of god towards you and his mercy no one of you hadbeen cleansed for ever

own until ye haveasked leave and have saluted its inmates this will be best for you haplyye will bear this in mind and if ye find no one therein then enter it not till leave be given you andif it be said to you go ye back then go ye back this will be moreblameless in you and god knoweth what ye do there shall be no harm in your entering houses in which no one dwelleth forthe supply of your needs and god knoweth what ye do openly and what ye hide speak unto the believers that they restrain their eyes and observecontinence thus will they be more pure god is well aware of what they do and speak to the believing women that they refrain their eyes and observecontinence and that they display not their ornaments except those which areexternal and that they throw their veils over their bosoms and display nottheir ornaments except to their husbands or their fathers or theirhusbands fathers or their sons or their husbands sons or their brothers or their brothers sons or their sisters sons or their women or theirslaves or male domestics who have no natural force or to children who notenot women s nakedness and let them not strike their feet together so as todiscover their hidden ornaments and be ye all turned to god o yebelievers that it may be well with you and marry those among you who are single and your good servants and thehandmaidens if they are poor god of his bounty will enrich them god isall bounteous knowing and let those who cannot find a match live in continence till god of hisbounty shall enrich them and to those of your slaves who desire a deed ofmanumission execute it for them if ye know good in them and give them aportion of the wealth of god which he hath given you force not your femaleslaves into sin in order that ye may gain the casual fruitions of thisworld if they wish to preserve their modesty yet if any one compel them then verily to them after their compulsion will god be forgiving merciful and now have we sent down to you clear signs and an instance from amongthose who flourished before you and a caution for the god fearing god is the light of the heavens and of the earth his light is like a nichein which is a lamp the lamp encased in glass the glass as it were aglistening star from a blessed tree is it lighted the olive neither of theeast nor of the west whose oil would well nigh shine out even though firetouched it not it is light upon light god guideth whom he will to hislight and god setteth forth parables to men for god knoweth all things in the temples which god hath allowed to be reared that his name may thereinbe remembered do men praise him morn and even men whom neither merchandise nor traffic beguile from the remembrance of god and from the observance of prayer and the payment of the stated alms through fear of the day when hearts shall throb and eyes shall roll that for their most excellent works may god recompense them and of hisbounty increase it to them more and more for god maketh provision for whomhe pleaseth without measure but as to the infidels their works are like the vapour in a plain which thethirsty dreameth to be water until when he cometh unto it he findeth it notaught but findeth that god is with him and he fully payeth him his account for swift to take account is god or like the darkness on the deep sea when covered by billows riding uponbillows above which are clouds darkness upon darkness when a man reachethforth his hand he cannot nearly see it he to whom god shall not give light no light at all hath he hast thou not seen how all in the heavens and in the earth uttereth thepraise of god the very birds as they spread their wings every creatureknoweth its prayer and its praise and god knoweth what they do god s the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and unto god the finalreturn hast thou not seen that god driveth clouds lightly forward then gathereththem together then pileth them in masses and then thou seest the rainforthcoming from their midst and he causeth clouds like mountains chargedwith hail to descend from the heaven and he maketh it to fall on whom hewill and from whom he will he turneth it aside the brightness of hislightning all but taketh away the sight god causeth the day and the night to take their turn verily in this isteaching for men of insight and god hath created every animal of water some go upon the belly some go upon two feet some go upon four feet godhath created what he pleased aye god hath power over all things now have we sent down distinct signs and god guideth whom he will into theright path for there are who say we believe on god and on the apostle and we obey yet after this a part of them turn back but these are not of thefaithful and when they are summoned before god and his apostle that he may judgebetween them lo a part of them withdraw but had the truth been on their side they would have come to him obedient what are they diseased of heart do they doubt are they afraid that god andhis apostles will deal unfairly with them nay themselves are the unjustdoers the words of the believers when called to god and his apostle that he mayjudge between them are only to say we have heard and we obey these arethey with whom it shall be well and whoso shall obey god and his apostle and shall dread god and fear him these are they that shall be the blissful and they have sworn by god with a most solemn oath that if thou give themthe word they will certainly march forth say swear ye not of more worthis obedience verily god is well aware of what ye do say obey god and obey the apostle suppose that ye turn back still theburden of his duty is on him only and the burden of your duty rests on you if ye obey him ye shall have guidance but plain preaching is all thatdevolves upon the apostle god hath promised to those of you who believe and do the things that areright that he will cause them to succeed others in the land as he gavesuccession to those who were before them and that he will establish for themthat religion which they delight in and that after their fears he will givethem security in exchange they shall worship me nought shall they join withme and whoso after this believe not they will be the impious but observe prayer and pay the stated alms and obey the apostle that haplyye may find mercy let not the infidels think that they can weaken god on his own earth theirdwelling place shall be the fire and right wretched the journey o ye who believe let your slaves and those of you who have not come of age ask leave of you three times a day ere they come into your presence beforethe morning prayer and when ye lay aside your garments at mid day and afterthe evening prayer these are your three times of privacy no blame shallattach to you or to them if after these times when ye go your rounds ofattendance on one another they come in without permission thus doth godmake clear to you his signs and god is knowing wise and when your children come of age let them ask leave to come into yourpresence as they who were before them asked it thus doth god make clear toyou his signs and god is knowing wise as to women who are past childbearing and have no hope of marriage no blameshall attach to them if they lay aside their outer garments but so as not toshew their ornaments yet if they abstain from this it will be better forthem and god heareth knoweth no crime shall it be in the blind or in the lame or in the sick to eatat your tables or in yourselves if ye eat in your own houses or in thehouses of your fathers or of your mothers or of your brothers or of yoursisters or of your uncles on the father s side or of your aunts on thefather s side or of your uncles on the mother s side or of your aunts onthe mother s side or in those of which ye possess the keys or in the houseof your friend no blame shall attach to you whether ye eat together orapart and when ye enter houses salute one another with a good and blessed greetingas from god thus doth god make clear to you his signs that haply ye maycomprehend them verily they only are believers who believe in god and his apostle and who when they are with him upon any affair of common interest depart not untilthey have sought his leave yes they who ask leave of thee are those whobelieve in god and his apostle and when they ask leave of thee on account ofany affairs of their own then grant it to those of them whom thou wilt andask indulgence for them of god for god is indulgent merciful address not the apostle as ye address one another god knoweth those of youwho withdraw quietly from the assemblies screening themselves behind others and let those who transgress his command beware lest some present troublebefall them or a grievous chastisement befall them hereafter is not whatever is in the heavens and the earth god s he knoweth your state and one day shall men be assembled before him and he will tell them of whatthey have done for god knoweth all things with this

the arabs thought that they ought notto admit the blind etc to their tables to eat alone or in a house ofwhich they were entrusted with the key etc lit make not the calling of the apostle among you

mothers they are not they only are their mothers whogave them birth they certainly say a blameworthy thing and an untruth but truly god is forgiving indulgent and those who thus put away their wives and afterwards would recall theirwords must free a captive before they can come together again to this areye warned to conform and god is aware of what ye do and he who findeth not a captive to set free shall fast two months insuccession before they two come together and he who shall not be able to doso shall feed sixty poor men this that he may believe in god and hisapostle these are the statutes of god and for the unbelievers is anafflictive chastisement truly they who oppose god and his apostle shall be brought low as those whowere before them were brought low and now have we sent

have forgotten them and god is witness over all things dost thou not see that god knoweth all that is in the heavens and all that isin the earth three persons speak not privately together but he is theirfourth nor five but he is their sixth nor fewer nor more but whereverthey be he is with them then on the day of resurrection he will tell them oftheir deeds for god knoweth all things hast thou not marked those who have been forbidden secret talk and return towhat they have been forbidden and talk privately together with wickedness and hate and disobedience towards the apostle and when they come to thee they greet thee not as god greeteth thee and they say among themselves why doth not god punish us for what we say hell shall be their meed theyshall be burned at its fire and a wretched

let the faithful trust o ye who believe when it is said to you make room in your assemblies then make ye room god will make room for you in paradise and when it issaid to you rise up then rise ye up god will uplift those of you whobelieve and those to whom the knowledge is given to lofty grades and godis cognisant of your actions o ye who believe when ye go to confer in private with the apostle give almsbefore such conference better will this be for you and more pure but if yehave not the means then truly god is lenient merciful do ye hesitate to give alms previously to your private conference then if yedo it not and god will excuse it in you at least observe prayer and paythe stated impost and obey god and his apostle for god is cognisant of youractions hast thou not remarked those who make friends of that people with whom god isangered they are neither of your party nor of theirs and they swear to alie knowing it to be such god hath got ready for them a severe torment for evil is that they do they make a cloak of their faith and turn others aside from the way of god wherefore a shameful torment awaiteth them not at all shall their wealth or their children avail them aught against god companions shall they be of the fire they shall abide therein for ever on the day when god shall raise them all they will swear to him as they nowswear to you deeming that it will avail them are they not yes they theliars satan hath gotten mastery over them and made them forget the remembrance ofgod these are satan s party what shall not verily the party of satan befor ever lost verily they who oppose god and his apostle shall be among the most vile godhath written this decree i will surely prevail and my apostles also truly god is strong mighty thou shalt not find that any of those who believe in god and in the lastday love him who opposeth god and his apostle even though they be theirfathers or their sons or their brethren or their nearest kin on thehearts of these

beguile and guide intothe torment of the flame whoever shall take him for his lord o men if ye doubt as to the resurrection yet of a truth have we createdyou of dust then of the moist germs of life then of clots of blood then ofpieces of flesh shapen and unshapen that we might give you proofs of ourpower and we cause one sex or the other at our pleasure to abide in thewomb until the appointed time then we bring you forth infants then permityou to reach your age of strength and one of you dieth and another of youliveth on to an age so abject that all his former knowledge is cleanforgotten and thou hast seen the earth dried up and barren but when wesend down the rain upon it it stirreth and swelleth and groweth every kindof luxuriant herb this for that god is the truth and that it is he

disputeth about god without knowledge or guidance orenlightening book turning aside in scorn to mislead others from the way of god disgrace shallbe his in this world and on the day of the resurrection we will make himtaste the torment of the burning this for thy handywork of old for god is not unjust to his servants there are some who serve god in a single point if good come upon one ofthem he

hurt him nor profit him this same is the far gone error he calleth on him who would sooner hurt than profit him surely bad thelord and surely bad the vassal but god will bring in those who shall believe and do the things that areright into gardens neath which the rivers flow for god doth that which hepleaseth let him who thinketh that god will not help his apostle in this world and inthe next stretch a cord aloft as if to destroy himself then let him cut it and see whether his devices can bring that to nought at which he was angry thus send we down the koran with its clear signs verses and

them on the day of resurrection for god is witness ofall things seest thou not that all in the heavens and all on the earth adoreth god thesun and the moon and the stars and the mountains and the trees and thebeasts and many men but of many is chastisement the due and whom god shall disgrace there shall be none to honour god doth thatwhich pleaseth him these the faithful and the infidels are the two disputants who disputeconcerning their lord but for those who have disbelieved garments of fireshall be cut out the boiling water shall be poured down upon their heads all that is in their bowels and their skins shall be dissolved and thereare maces of iron for them so oft as they for very anguish would fain come forth thence back shallthey be turned into it and taste ye the torment of

pearls and their raiment thereinshall be of silk for they were guided to the best of words guided to the glorious path but those who believe not and seduce others from the way of god and fromthe holy mosque which we have appointed to all men alike for those who abidetherein and for the stranger and those who seek impiously to profane it we will cause to taste a grievouspunishment and call to mind when we assigned the site of the house to abraham and said unite not aught with me in worship and cleanse my house for those who go inprocession round it and who stand or bow in worship and proclaim to the peoples a pilgrimage let them come to thee on foot andon every fleet camel arriving by every deep defile that they may bear witness of its benefits to them and may make mention ofgod s name on the appointed days over the brute beasts with which he hathsupplied them for sustenance therefore eat thereof yourselves and feed theneedy the poor then let them bring the neglect of their persons to a close and let thempay their vows and circuit the ancient house this do and he that respecteth the sacred ordinances of god this will bebest for him with his lord the flesh of cattle is allowed you save of thosealready specified to you shun ye therefore the pollutions of idols andshun ye the word of falsehood sound in faith godward uniting no god with him for whoever uniteth godswith god is like that which falleth from on high and the birds snatch itaway or the wind wafteth it to a distant place this do and they who respect the rites of god perform an action whichproceedeth from piety of heart ye may obtain advantages from the cattle up to the set time for slaying them then the place for sacrificing them is at the ancient house and to every people have we appointed rites that they may commemorate thename of god over the brute beasts which he hath provided for them and yourgod is the one god to him therefore surrender yourselves and bear thougood tidings to those who humble them whose hearts when mention is made of god thrill with awe and to those whoremain steadfast under all that be falleth them and observe prayer and givealms of that with which we have supplied them and the camels have we appointed you for the sacrifice to god much good haveye in them make mention therefore of the name of god over them when yeslay them as they stand in a row and when they are fallen over on theirsides eat of them and feed him who is content and asketh not and him whoasketh thus have we subjected them to you to the intent ye should bethankful by no means can their flesh reach unto god neither their blood but piety onyour part reacheth him thus hath he subjected them to you that ye mightmagnify god for his guidance moreover announce to those who do good deeds that god will ward off mischief from believers for god loveth not the false the infidel a sanction is given to those who because they have suffered outrages havetaken up arms and verily god is well able to succour them those who have been driven forth from their homes wrongfully only becausethey say our lord is the god and if god had not repelled some men byothers cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques wherein the nameof god is ever commemorated would surely have been destroyed and him whohelpeth god will god surely help for god is right strong mighty those who if we establish them in this land will observe prayer and paythe alms of obligation and enjoin what is right and forbid what is evil and the final issue of all things is unto god moreover if they charge thee with imposture then already before them thepeople of noah and ad and themoud and the people of abraham and the peopleof lot and the dwellers in madian have charged their prophets withimposture moses too was charged with imposture and i bore long with theunbelievers then seize on them and how great was the change i wrought and how many cities which had been ungodly and whose roofs are now laid lowin ruin have we destroyed and wells have been abandoned and lofty castles have they not journeyed through the land have they not hearts to understandwith or ears to hear with it is not that to these sights their eyes areblind but the hearts in their breasts are blind and they will bid thee to hasten the chastisement but god cannot fail histhreat and verily a day with thy lord is as a thousand years as yereckon them how many cities have i long borne with wicked though they were yet thenlaid hold on them to chastise them unto me shall all return say o men i am only your open warner and they who believe and do the things that are right shall have forgivenessand an honourable provision but those who strive to invalidate our signs shall be inmates of hell we have not sent any apostle or prophet before thee among whose desiressatan injected not some wrong desire but god shall bring to nought thatwhich satan had suggested thus shall god affirm his revelations for god isknowing wise that he may make that which satan hath injected a trial to those in whosehearts is a disease and whose hearts are hardened verily the wicked are ina far gone severance from the truth and that they to whom the knowledge hath been given may know that thekoran is the truth from thy lord and may believe in it and their hearts mayacquiesce in it for god is surely the guider of those who believe into thestraight path but the infidels will not cease to doubt concerning it until the hour comesuddenly upon them or until the chastisement of the day of desolation comeupon them on that day the kingdom shall be god s he shall judge between them and theywho shall have believed and done the things that are right shall be ingardens of delight but they who were infidels and treated our signs as lies these then their s ashameful chastisement and as to those who fled their country for the cause of god and wereafterwards slain or died surely with goodly provision will god provide forthem for verily god he surely is the best of providers he will assuredly bring them in with an in bringing that shall please themwell for verily god is right knowing gracious so shall it be and whoever in making exact reprisal for injury done him shall again be wronged god will assuredly aid him for god is most merciful gracious so shall it be for that god causeth the night to enter in upon the day andhe causeth the day to enter in upon the night and for that god heareth seeth so shall it be for that god is the truth and because what they call onbeside him is vanity and because god is the lofty the mighty seest thou not that god sendeth down water from heaven and that on themorrow the earth is clad with verdure for god is benignant cognisant ofall his all in the heavens and all on earth and verily god he assuredly isthe rich the praiseworthy seest thou not that god hath put under you whatever is in the earth and theships which traverse the sea at his bidding and he holdeth back the heaventhat it fall not on the earth unless he permit it for god is right graciousto mankind merciful and he it is who hath given you life then will cause you to die then willgive you life of a truth man is all ungrateful to every people have we appointed observances which they observe therefore let them not dispute this matter with thee but bid them to thy lord forthou art on the right way but if they debate with thee then say god best knoweth what ye do god will judge between you on the day of resurrection as to the matterswherein ye differ knowest thou not that god knoweth whatever is in the heaven and on the earth this truly is written in the book this truly is easy for god they worship beside god that for which he hath sent down no warranty andthat of which they have no knowledge but for those who commit this wrong nohelper and when our clear signs are rehearsed to them thou mayst perceive disdainin the countenances of the infidels scarce can they refrain from rushing toattack those who rehearse our signs to them say shall i tell you of worsethan this the fire which god hath threatened to those who believe not wretched the passage thither o men a parable is set forth to you wherefore hearken to it verily theyon whom ye call beside god cannot create a fly though they assemble for it and if the fly carry off aught from them they cannot take it away from it weak the suppliant and the supplicated unworthy the estimate they form of god for god is right powerful mighty god chooseth messengers from among the angels and from among men verily godheareth seeth he knoweth what is before them and what is behind them and unto god shallall things return believers bow down and prostrate yourselves and worship your lord and workrighteousness that you may fare well and do valiantly in the cause of god as it behoveth you to do for him hehath elected you and hath not laid on you any hardship in religion thefaith of your father abraham he hath named you the muslimsheretofore and in this book that the apostles may be a witness against you and that ye may be witnesses against the rest of mankind therefore observeprayer and pay the legal impost and cleave fast to god he is your liegelord a goodly

hearts of thefaithful that they might add faith to their faith for god s are the armiesof the heavens and of the earth and god is knowing wise and that he may bring the believing men and the believing women into gardens neath whose trees the rivers flow to dwell therein for ever and that hemay cancel their evil deeds for this is the great bliss with god and that he may punish the hypocritical men

whoso shall turn back he will punish him with a sore punishment well pleased now hath god been with the believers when they plighted fealtyto thee under the tree and he knew what was in their hearts therefore didhe send down upon them a spirit of secure repose and rewarded them with aspeedy victory and with the rich booty which they took for god is mighty wise god promised you the taking of a rich booty and sped it to you and hewithheld men s hands from you for a sign to the faithful and that he mightguide you along the right way and other booty over which ye have not yet had power but now hath godcompassed them for you for god is over all things potent if the infidels shall fight against you they shall assuredly turn theirbacks then neither protector nor helper shall they find such is god s method carried into effect of old no change canst thou find ingod s mode of dealing and he it was who held their hands from you and your hands from them in thevalley of mecca after that he had given you the victory over them for godsaw what ye did these are they who believed not and kept you away from the sacred mosque aswell as the offering which was prevented from reaching the place ofsacrifice and had it not been that ye would have trodden down believers both men and women whom ye knew not so that a crime might have lighted onyou without your knowledge on their account and that god would bring whom hewill within his mercy this would have been otherwise ordered had they beenapart we had surely punished such of them as believed not with a sorepunishment when the unbelievers had fostered rage in their hearts the rage of ignorance of heathens god sent down his peace on his apostle and on the faithful andstablished in them the word of piety for they were most worthy and deservingof it and god knoweth all things now hath god in truth made good to his apostle the dream in which he said ye shall surely enter the sacred mosque if god will in full security having your heads shaved and your hair cut ye shall not fear for he knowethwhat ye know not and he hath ordained you beside this a speedy victory it is he who hath sent his apostle with the guidance and the religion oftruth that he may exalt it above every religion and enough for thee is thistestimony on the part of god muhammad is the apostle of god and his comrades are vehement against theinfidels but full of tenderness among themselves thou mayst see them bowingdown prostrating themselves imploring favours from god and his acceptance their tokens are on their faces the marks of their prostrations

way to you inmany matters ye would certainly become guilty of a crime but god hathendeared the faith to you and hath given it favour in your hearts and hathmade unbelief and wickedness and disobedience hateful to you such are theywho pursue a right course through the bounty and grace which is from god and god is knowing wise if two bodies of the faithful are at war then make ye peace between them and if the one of them wrong the other fight against that party which doththe wrong until they come back to the precepts of god if they come back make peace between them with fairness and act impartially god loveth thosewho act with impartiality only the faithful are brethren wherefore make peace between your brethren and fear god that ye may obtain mercy o believers let not men laugh men to scorn who haply may be better thanthemselves neither let women laugh women to scorn who may haply be betterthan themselves neither defame one another nor call one another bynicknames bad is it to be called wicked after having professed the faith and whoso repent not of this are doers of wrong o believers avoid frequent suspicions for some suspicions are a crime andpry not neither let the one of you traduce another in his absence would anyone of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother surely ye would loatheit and fear ye god for god is ready to turn merciful o men verily we have created you of a male and a female and we havedivided you into peoples and tribes that ye might have knowledge one ofanother truly the most worthy of honour in the sight of god is he whofeareth him most verily god is knowing cognisant the arabs of the desert say we believe say thou ye believe not butrather say we profess islam for the faith hath not yet found its way intoyour hearts but if ye obey god and his apostle he will not allow you tolose any of your actions for god is indulgent merciful the true believers are those only who believe in god and his apostle andafterwards doubt not and who contend with their substance and their personson the path of god these are the sincere say will ye teach god about your religion when god knoweth whatever is inthe heavens and on the earth yea god hath knowledge of all things they taunt thee with their having embraced islam say taunt me not withyour having embraced islam god rather taunteth you with his having guidedyou to the faith acknowledge

favour on the prophet sura ix immunity cxiii medina versesan immunity from god and his apostle to those with whom ye are in league among the polytheist arabs those who join gods with god go ye therefore at large in the land four months but know that god yeshall not weaken and that those who believe not god will put to shame and a proclamation on the part of god and his apostle to the people on theday of the greater pilgrimage that god is free from any engagement with thevotaries of other gods with god as is his apostle if therefore ye turn togod it will be better for you but if ye turn back then know that ye shallnot weaken god and to those who believe not announce thou a grievouspunishment but this concerneth not those polytheists with whom ye are in league and whoshall have afterwards in no way failed you nor aided anyone against you observe therefore engagement with them through the whole time of theirtreaty for god loveth those who fear him and when the sacred months are passed kill those who join other gods withgod wherever ye shall find them and seize them besiege them and lay waitfor them with every kind of ambush but if they shall convert and observeprayer and pay the obligatory alms then let them go their way for god isgracious merciful if any one of those who join gods with god ask an asylum of thee grant himan asylum that he may hear the word of god and

hisway evil is it that they do they regard not in a believer either ties of blood or faith these are thetransgressors yet if they turn to god and observe prayer and pay the impost then are theyyour brethren in religion we make clear our signs to those who understand but if after alliance made they break their oaths and revile your religion then do battle with the ring leaders of infidelity for no oaths are bindingwith them that they may desist what will ye not fight against those meccans who have broken their oaths andaimed to expel your apostle and attacked you first will ye dread them godis more worthy of your fear if ye are believers so make war on them by your hands will god chastise them and will put themto shame and will give you victory over them and will heal the bosoms of apeople who believe and will take away the wrath of their hearts god will be turned unto whom hewill and god is knowing wise think ye that ye shall be forsaken as if god did not yet know those among youwho do valiantly and take none for their friends beside god and hisapostle and the faithful god is well apprised of your doings it is not for the votaries of other gods with god witnesses againstthemselves of infidelity to visit the temples of god these vain theirworks and in the fire shall they abide for ever he only should visit the temples of god who believeth in god and the lastday and observeth prayer and payeth the legal alms and dreadeth none butgod these haply will be among the rightly guided do ye place the giving drink to the pilgrims and the visitation of thesacred temple

good pleasure doth their lord sendthem and of gardens in which lasting pleasure shall be theirs therein shall they abide for ever for god with him is a great reward o believers make not friends of

wait until god shallhimself enter on his work and god guideth not the impious now hath god helped you in many battlefields and on the day of honein when ye prided yourselves on your numbers but it availed you nothing andthe earth with all its breadth became too straight for you then turned yeyour backs in flight then did god send down his spirit of repose upon his apostle and upon thefaithful

they who join gods with god are unclean let them not therefore after this their year come near the sacred temple and if ye fearwant god if he please will enrich you of his abundance for god isknowing wise make war upon such of those to whom the scriptures have been given as believenot in god or in the last day and who forbid not that which god and hisapostle have forbidden and who profess not the profession of the truth until they pay tribute out of hand and they be humbled the jews say ezra ozair is a son of god and the christians say themessiah is a son of god such the sayings in their mouths they resemble thesaying of the infidels of old god do battle with them how are theymisguided they take their teachers and their monks and the messiah son of mary forlords beside god though bidden to worship one god only there is no godbut he far from his glory be what they associate with him fain would they put out god s light with their mouths but god only desirethto perfect his light albeit the infidels abhor it he it is who hath sent his apostle with the guidance and a religion of thetruth that he may make it victorious over every other religion albeitthey who assign partners to god be averse from it o believers of a truth many of the teachers and monks do devour man ssubstance in vanity and turn them from the way of god but to those whotreasure up gold and silver and expend it not in the way of god announcetidings of a grievous torment on that day their treasures shall be heated in hell fire and theirforeheads and their sides and their backs shall be branded with them this is what ye have treasured up for yourselves taste therefore yourtreasures twelve months is the number of months with god according to god s book since the day when he created the heavens and the earth of these four aresacred this is the right usage but wrong not yourselves therein attackthose who join gods with god in all as they attack you in all and know thatgod is with those who fear him to carry over a sacred month to another is only a growth of infidelity theinfidels are led into error by it they allow it one year and forbid itanother that they may make good the number of months which god hathhallowed and they allow that which god hath prohibited the evil of theirdeeds hath been prepared for them by satan for god guideth not the peoplewho do not believe o believers what possessed you that when it was said to you march forthon the way of god ye sank heavily earthwards what prefer ye the life ofthis world to the next but the fruition of this mundane life in respect ofthat which is to come is but little unless ye march forth with a grievous chastisement will he chastise you andhe will place another people in your stead and ye shall in no way harm him for over everything is god potent if ye assist not your prophet god assisted him formerly when theunbelievers drove him forth in company with a second only when they twowere in the cave when the prophet said to his companion be not distressed verily god is with us and god sent down his tranquillity upon him andstrengthened him with hosts ye saw not and made the word of those whobelieved not the abased and the word of god was the exalted for god ismighty wise march ye forth the light and heavy armed and contend with your substanceand your persons on the way of god this if ye know it will be better foryou had there been a near advantage and a short journey they would certainlyhave followed thee but the way seemed long to them yet will they swear bygod had we been able we had surely gone forth with you they are self destroyers and god knoweth that they are surely liars god forgive thee why didst thou give them leave to stay behind ere they whomake true excuses had become known to thee and thou hadst known the liars they who believe in god and in the last day will not ask leave of thee to beexempt from contending with their substance and their persons but godknoweth those who fear him they only will ask thy leave who believe not in god and the last day andwhose hearts are full of doubts and who are tossed up and down in theirdoubtings moreover had they been desirous to take the field they would have got readyfor that purpose the munitions of war but god was averse to theirmarching forth and made them laggards and it was said sit ye at home withthose who sit had they taken the field with you they would only have added a burden toyou and have hurried about among you stirring you up to sedition and somethere are among you who would have listened to them and god knoweth the evildoers of old aimed they at sedition and deranged thy affairs until the trutharrived and the behest of god became apparent averse from it though theywere some of them say to thee allow me to remain at home and expose me not tothe trial have they not fallen into a trial already but verily hell shallenviron the infidels if a success betide thee it annoyeth them but if a reverse betide thee they say we took our own measures before and they turn their backs andare glad say nothing can befall us but what god hath destined for us our liege lord is he and on god let the faithful trust say await ye for us other than one of the two best things but we awaitfor you the infliction of a chastisement by god from himself or at ourhands wait ye then we verily will wait with you say make ye your offerings willingly or by constraint it cannot be acceptedfrom you because ye are a wicked people and nothing hindreth the acceptance of their offerings but that they believenot in god and his apostle and discharge not the duty of prayer but withsluggishness and make not offerings but with reluctance let not therefore their riches or their children amaze thee god is onlyminded to punish them by means of these in this life present and that theirsouls may depart while they are unbelievers and they swear by god that they are indeed of you yet they are not of you but they are people who are afraid of you if they find a place of refuge or caves or a hiding place they assuredlyturn towards it and haste thereto some of them also defame thee in regard to the alms yet if a part be giventhem they are content but if no part be given them behold they are angry would that they were satisfied with that which god and his apostle had giventhem and would say god sufficeth us god will vouchsafe unto us of hisfavour and so will his apostle verily unto god do we make our suit but alms are only to be given to the poor and the needy and those whocollect them and to those whose hearts are won to islam and for ransoms and for debtors and for the cause of god and the wayfarer this is anordinance from god and god is knowing wise there are some of them who injure the prophet and say he is all ear say an ear of good to you he believeth in god and believeth the believers and is a mercy to such of you as believe but they who injure the apostle of god shall suffer a dolorous chastisement they swear to you by god to please you but worthier is god and his apostle that they should please him if they are believers know they not that for him who opposeth god and his apostle is surely thefire of hell in which he shall remain for ever this is the great ignominy the hypocrites are afraid lest a sura should be sent down concerning them totell them plainly what is in their hearts say scoff ye but god will bringto light that which ye are afraid of and if thou question them they will surely say we were only discoursingand jesting say what do ye scoff at god and his signs and his apostle make no excuse from faith ye have passed to infidelity if we forgive someof you we will punish others for that they have been evil doers hypocritical men and women imitate one another they enjoin what is evil and forbid what is just and shut up their hands they have forgotten god and he hath forgotten them verily the hypocrites are the perverse doers god promiseth the hypocritical men and women and the unbelievers the fireof hell therein shall they abide this their sufficing portion and god hathcursed them and a lasting torment shall be theirs ye act like those who flourished before you mightier were they than you inprowess and more abundant in wealth and children and they enjoyed theirportion so ye also enjoy your portion as they who were before you enjoyedtheirs and ye hold discourses like their discourses these vain their worksboth for this world and for that which is to come these they are the lostones hath not the history reached them of those who were before them of thepeople of noah and of ad and of themoud and of the people of abraham and of the inhabitants of madian and of the overthrown cities theirapostles came to them with clear proofs of their mission god would not dealwrongly by them but they dealt wrongly by themselves the faithful of both sexes are mutual friends they enjoin what is just andforbid what is evil they observe prayer and pay the legal impost and theyobey god and his apostle on these will god have mercy verily god ismighty wise to the faithful both men and women god promiseth gardens neath which therivers flow in which they shall abide and goodly mansions in the gardens ofeden but best of all will be god s good pleasure in them this will be thegreat bliss o prophet contend against the infidels and the hypocrites and be rigorouswith them hell shall be their dwelling place wretched the journey thither they swear by god that they said no such thing yet spake they the word ofinfidelity and from muslims became unbelievers they planned what they couldnot effect and only disapproved of it because god and his apostle hadenriched them by his bounty if they repent it will be better for them butif they fall back into their sin with a grievous chastisement will godchastise them in this world and the next and on earth they shall haveneither friend nor protector some there are of them who made this agreement with god if truly he give usof his bounties we will surely give alms and surely be of the righteous yet when he had vouchsafed them of his bounty they became covetous thereof and turned their backs and withdrew afar off so he caused hypocrisy to take its turn in their hearts until the day onwhich they shall meet him for that they failed their promise to god and thatthey were liars know they not that god knoweth their secrets and their private talk and thatgod knoweth the secret things they who traduce such of the faithful as give their alms freely and thosewho find nothing to give but their earnings and scoff at them god shallscoff at them and there is a grievous torment in store for them ask thou forgiveness for them or ask it not it will be the same if thouask forgiveness for them seventy times god will by no means forgive them this for that they believe not in god and his apostle and god guideth notthe ungodly people they who were left at home were delighted to stay behind god s apostle andwere averse from contending with their riches and their persons for the causeof god and said march not out in the heat say a fiercer heat will bethe fire of hell would that they understood this little therefore let them laugh and much let them weep as the meed oftheir doings if god bring thee back from the fight to some of them and they ask thy leaveto take the field say by no means shall ye ever take the field with me andby no means shall ye fight an enemy with me ye were well pleased to sit athome at the first crisis sit ye at home then with those who lag behind never pray thou over anyone of them who dieth or stand at his grave because they believed not in god and his apostle and died in theirwickedness let not their riches or their children astonish thee through these god isfain only to punish them in this world and that their souls should departwhile they are still infidels when a sura was sent down with believe in god and go forth to war with hisapostle those of them who are possessed of riches demanded exemption andsaid allow us to be with those who sit at home well content were they to be with those who stay behind for a seal hath beenset on their hearts so that they understand not but the apostle and those who share his faith contend for the faith withpurse and person and these all good things await them and these are theywho shall be happy god hath made ready for them gardens neath which the rivers flow whereinthey shall remain for ever this will be the great bliss some arabs of the desert came with excuses praying exemption and they whohad gainsaid god and his apostle sat at home a grievous punishment shalllight on such of them as believe not it shall be no crime in the weak and in the sick and in those who find notthe means of contributing to stay at home provided they are sincere withgod and his apostle against those who act virtuously there is no cause ofblame and god is gracious merciful nor against those to whom when they came to thee that thou shouldst mountthem thou didst say i find not wherewith to mount you and they turnedaway their eyes shedding floods of tears for grief because they found nomeans to contribute only is there cause of blame against those who though they are rich askthee for exemption they are pleased to be with those who stay behind andgod hath set a seal upon their hearts they have no knowledge they will excuse themselves to you when ye come back to them say excuseyourselves not we cannot believe you now hath god informed us about you god will behold your doings and so will his apostle to him who knowethalike things hidden and things manifest shall ye hereafter be brought back and he will tell you what ye have done they will adjure you by god when ye are come back to them to withdraw fromthem withdraw from them then for they are unclean their dwelling shall behell in recompense for their deserts they will adjure you to take pleasure in them but if ye take pleasure inthem god truly will take no pleasure in those who act corruptly the arabs of the desert are most stout in unbelief and dissimulation andlikelier it is that they should be unaware of the laws which god hath sentdown to his apostle and god is knowing wise of the arabs of the desert there are some who reckon what they expend in thecause of god as tribute and wait for some change of fortune to befall you achange for evil shall befall them god is the hearer the knower and of the arabs of the desert some believe in god and in the last day anddeem those alms an approach to god and to the apostle s prayers are they nottheir approach into his mercy shall god lead them yes god is indulgent merciful as for those who led the way the first of the mohadjers and the ansars and those who have followed their noble conduct god is well pleased withthem and they with him he hath made ready for them gardens under whosetrees the rivers flow to abide therein for aye this shall be the greatbliss and of the arabs of the desert round about you some are hypocrites and ofthe people of medina some are stubborn in hypocrisy thou knowest them not muhammad we know them twice will we chastise them then shall they begiven over to a great chastisement others have owned their faults and with an action that is right they havemixed another that is wrong god will haply be turned to them for god isforgiving merciful take alms of their substance that thou mayst cleanse and purify themthereby and pray for them for thy prayers shall assure their minds and godheareth knoweth know they not that when his servants turn to him with repentance godaccepteth it and that he accepteth alms and that god is he who turneth themerciful say work ye but god will behold your work and so will his apostle and thefaithful and ye shall be brought before him who knoweth alike the hidden andthe manifest and he will tell you of all your works and others await the decision of god whether he will punish them or whetherhe will be turned unto them but god is knowing wise there are some who have built a mosque for mischief and for infidelity and to disunite the faithful and in expectation of him who in time past warred against god and his apostle they will surely swear our aim was onlygood but god is witness that they are liars never set thou foot in it there is a mosque founded from its first dayin piety more worthy is it that thou enter therein therein are men whoaspire to purity and god loveth the purified which of the two is best he who hath founded his building on the fear of godand the desire to please him or he who hath founded his building on thebrink of an undermined bank washed away by torrents so that it rusheth withhim into the fire of hell but god guideth not the doers of wrong their building which they have built will not cease to cause uneasiness intheir hearts until their hearts are cut in pieces god is knowing wise verily of the faithful hath god bought their persons and their substance oncondition of paradise for them in return on the path of god shall theyfight and slay and be slain a promise for this is pledged in the law andin the evangel and in the koran and who more faithful in to his engagementthan god rejoice therefore in the contract that ye have contracted forthis shall be the great bliss those who turn to god and those who serve who praise who fast who bowdown who prostrate themselves who enjoin what is just and forbid what isevil and keep to the bounds of god wherefore bear these goodtidings to the faithful it is not for the prophet or the faithful to pray for the forgiveness ofthose even though they be of kin who associate other beings with god afterit hath been made clear to them that they are to be the inmates of hell for neither did abraham ask forgiveness for his father but in pursuance of apromise which he had promised to him but when it was shewn him that he wasan enemy to god he declared himself clear of him yet abraham was pitiful kind nor is it for god to lead a people into error after he hath guided themaright until that which they ought to dread hath been clearly shewn them verily god knoweth all things god his the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth he maketh alive andkilleth ye have no patron or helper save god now hath god turned him unto the prophet and unto the refugees mohadjers and unto the helpers ansars who followed him in the hour of distress after that the hearts of a part of them had well nigh failed them thenturned he unto them for he was kind to them merciful he hath also turned him unto the three who were left behind so that theearth spacious as it is became too strait for them and their souls becameso straitened within them that they bethought them that there was no refugefrom god but unto himself then was he turned to them that they might beturned to him for god is he that turneth the merciful believers fear god and be with the sincere no cause had the people of medina and the arabs of the desert around them toabandon god s apostle or to prefer their own lives to his because neitherthirst nor the labour nor hunger could come upon them when on path ofgod neither do they step a step which may anger the unbelievers neitherdo they receive from the enemy any damage but it is written down to them asa good work verily god suffereth not the reward of the righteous to perish nor give they alms either small or great nor traverse they a torrent but itis thus reckoned to them that god may reward them with better than they havewrought the faithful must not march forth all together to the wars and if a party ofevery band of them march not out it is that they may instruct themselves intheir religion and may warn their people when they come back to them thatthey take heed to themselves believers wage war against such of the infidels as are your neighbours andlet them find you rigorous and know that god is with those who fear him whenever a sura is sent down there are some of them who say whose faithhath it increased it will increase the faith of those who believe and theyshall rejoice but as to those in whose hearts is a disease it will add doubt to theirdoubt and they shall die infidels do they not see that they are proved every year once or twice yet they turnnot neither are they warned and whenever a sura is sent down they look at one another doth anyone see you then turn they aside god shall turn their hearts aside because they are a people devoid of understanding now hath an apostle come unto you from among yourselves your iniquitiespress heavily upon him he is careful over you and towards the faithful compassionate merciful if they turn away say god sufficeth me there is no god but he in him puti my trust he is the possessor of the glorious throne the immunity is said by some commentators to have formed originally onesura with the eighth p and that on this account the usual formula ofinvocation is not prefixed the caliph othman accounted for this

pleasure that islam be yourreligion but whoso without wilful leanings to wrong shall be forced byhunger to transgress to him verily will god be indulgent merciful they will ask thee what is made lawful for them say those things which aregood are legalised to you and the prey of beasts of chase which ye havetrained like dogs teaching them as god hath taught you eat therefore ofwhat they shall catch for you and make mention of the name of god over it and fear god verily swift is god to reckon this day things healthful are legalised to you and the meats of those whohave received the scriptures are allowed to you as your meats are to them and you are permitted to marry virtuous women who are believers and virtuouswomen of those who have received the scriptures before you when you shallhave provided them their portions living chastely with them withoutfornication and without taking concubines vain the works of him who shallrenounce the faith and in the next world he shall be of the lost o believers when ye address yourselves to prayer wash your faces and yourhands up to the elbow and wipe your heads and your feet to the ankles and if ye have become unclean then purify yourselves but if ye are sick oron a journey or if one of you come from the place of retirement or if yehave touched women and ye find no water then take clean sand and rub yourfaces and your hands with it god desireth not to lay a burden upon you buthe desireth to purify you and he would fill up the measure of his favourupon you that ye may be grateful and remember the favour of god upon you and his covenant which he hathcovenanted with you when ye said we have heard and will obey and feargod verily god knoweth the very secrets of the breast o believers stand up as witnesses for god by righteousness and let not ill will at any induce you not to act uprightly act uprightly next will thisbe to the fear of god and fear ye god verily god is apprised of what yedo god hath promised to those who believe and do the things that are right that for them is pardon and a great reward but they who are infidels and treat our signs as lies these shall be matedwith hell fire o believers recollect god s favour upon you when certain folk were mindedto stretch forth their hands against you but he kept their hands from you fear god then and on god let the faithful trust of old did god accept the covenant of the children of israel and out ofthem we raised up twelve leaders and god said verily i will be with you if ye observe prayer and pay the obligatory alms and believe in my apostlesand help them and lend god a liberal loan i will surely put away from youyour evil deeds and i will bring you into gardens neath which the riversflow but whoso of you after this believeth not hath gone astray from theeven path but for their breaking their covenant we have cursed them and have hardenedtheir hearts they shift the words of scripture from their places and haveforgotten part of what they were taught thou wilt not cease to discoverdeceit on their part except in a few of them but forgive them and pass itover verily god loveth those who act generously and of those who say we are christians have we accepted the covenant butthey too have forgotten a part of what they were taught wherefore we havestirred up enmity and hatred among them that shall last till the day of theresurrection and in the end will god tell them of their doings o people of the scriptures now is our apostle come to you to clear up to youmuch that ye concealed of those scriptures and to pass over many things nowhath a light and a clear book come to you from god by which god will guidehim who shall follow after his good pleasure to paths of peace and willbring them out of the darkness to the light by his will and to the straightpath will he guide them infidels now are they who say verily god is the messiah ibn maryam son ofmary say and who could aught obtain from god if he chose to destroy themessiah ibn maryam and his mother and all who are on the earth together for with god is the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of allthat is between them he createth what he will and over all things is godpotent say the jews and christians sons are we of god and his beloved say whythen doth he chastise you for your sins nay ye are but a part of the menwhom he hath created he will pardon whom he pleaseth and chastise whom hepleaseth and with god is the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth and of all that is between them and unto him shall all things return o people of the book now hath our apostle come to you to clear up to you thecessation of apostles lest you should say there hath come to us nobearer of good tidings nor any warner but now hath a bearer of goodtidings and a warner reached you and god is almighty and remember when moses said to his people o my people call to mind thegoodness of god towards you when he appointed prophets among you andappointed you kings and gave you what never had been given before to anyhuman beings enter o my people the holy land which god hath destined for you turn notback lest ye be overthrown to your ruin they said o moses therein are men of might and verily we can by no meansenter it till they be gone forth but if they go forth from it then verilywill we enter in then said two men of those who feared their lord and to whom god had beengracious enter in upon them by the gate and when ye enter it ye overcome if ye be believers put ye your trust in god they said o moses never can we enter while they remain therein go thouand thy lord and fight for here will we sit us down he said o my lord verily of none am i master but of myself and my brother put thou therefore a difference between us and this ungodly people he said verily the land shall be forbidden them forty years they shallwander in the earth perplexed fret not thyself therefore for the ungodlypeople relate to them exactly the story of the sons of adam when they each offeredan offering accepted from the one of them and not accepted from the other the one said i will surely slay thee said the other god only acceptedfrom those that fear him even if thou stretch forth thine hand against me to slay me i will notstretch forth my hand against thee to slay thee truly i fear god the lord ofthe worlds yea rather would i that thou shouldest bear my sin and thine own sin andthat thou become an inmate of the fire for that is the recompense of theunjust doers and his passion led him to slay his brother and he slew him and he becameone of those who perish and god sent a raven which scratched upon the ground to shew him how hemight hide his brother s wrong he said o woe is me am i too weak tobecome like this raven and to hide away my brother s wrong and he becameone of the repentant for this cause have we ordained to the children of israel that he who slayethany one unless it be a person guilty of manslaughter or of spreadingdisorders in the land shall be as though he had slain all mankind but thathe who saveth a life shall be as though he had saved all mankind alive of old our apostles came to them with the proofs of their mission thenverily after this most of them committed excesses in the land only the recompense of those who war against god and his apostle and goabout to commit disorders on the earth shall be that they shall be slain orcrucified or have their alternate hands and feet cut off or be banished theland this their disgrace in this world and in the next a great tormentshall be theirs except those who ere you have them in your power shall repent for knowthat god is forgiving merciful o ye who believe fear god desire union with him contend earnestly on hispath that you may attain to happiness as to the infidels if that they had twice the riches of the earth to be theirransom from torment on the day of resurrection it should not be acceptedfrom them and a dolorous torment shall be their s fain would they come forth from the fire but forth from it they shall notcome and a lasting torment shall be their s as to the thief whether man or woman cut ye off their hands in recompensefor their doings this is a penalty by way of warning from god himself andgod is mighty wise but whoever shall turn him to god after this his wickedness and amend godtruly will be turned to him for god is forgiving merciful knowest thou not that the sovereignty of the heavens and of the earth isgod s he chastiseth whom he will and whom he will he forgiveth and godhath power over all things o apostle let not those who vie with one another in speeding to infidelityvex thee of those who say with their mouths we believe but whose heartsbelieve not or of the jews listeners to a lie listeners to others but whocome not to thee they shift the words of the law from their places and say if this be brought to you receive it but if this be not brought to you then beware of it for him whom god would mislead thou canst in no wiseprevail with god they whose hearts god shall not please to cleanse shallsuffer disgrace in this world and in the next a grievous punishment listeners to a falsehood and greedy devourers of the forbidden if therefore they have recourse to thee then judge between them or withdrawfrom them if thou withdraw from them then can they have no power to injurethee but if thou judge then judge between them with equity verily godloveth those who deal equitably but how shall they make thee their judge since they possess already the law in which are the behests of god and have not obeyed it after this theywill turn their backs but such are not believers verily we have sent down the law towrat wherein are guidance and light byit did the prophets who professed islam judge the jews and the doctors andthe teachers judged by that portion of the book of god of which they werethe keepers and the witnesses therefore o jews fear not men but fear me and barter not away my signs for a mean price and whoso will not judge bywhat god hath sent down such are the infidels and therein have we enacted for them life for life and eye for eye andnose for nose and ear for ear and tooth for tooth and for woundsretaliation whoso shall compromise it as alms shall have therein theexpiation of his sin and whoso will not judge by what god hath sent down such are the transgressors and in the footsteps of the prophets caused we jesus the son of mary tofollow confirming the law which was before him and we gave him the evangelwith its guidance and light confirmatory of the preceding law a guidanceand warning to those who fear god and that the people of the evangel may judge according to what god hath sentdown therein and whoso will not judge by what god hath sent down such arethe perverse and to thee we have sent down the book of the koran with truth confirmatoryof previous scriptures and their safeguard judge therefore between them bywhat god hath sent down and follow not their desires by deserting the truthwhich hath come unto thee to every one of you have we given a rule and abeaten track and if god had pleased he had surely made you all one people but he wouldtest you by what he hath given to each be emulous then in good deeds togod shall ye all return and he will tell you concerning the subjects of yourdisputes wherefore do thou judge between them by what god hath sent down and follownot their wishes but be on thy guard against them lest they beguile theefrom any of those precepts which god hath sent down to thee and if they turnback then know thou that for some of their crimes doth god choose to punishthem for truly most men are perverse desire they therefore the judgments of the times of pagan ignorance butwhat better judge can there be than god for those who believe firmly o believers take not the jews or christians as friends they are but oneanother s friends if any one of you taketh them for his friends he surelyis one of them god will not guide the evil doers so shalt thou see the diseased at heart speed away to them and say we fearlest a change of fortune befall us but haply god will of himself bringabout some victory or event of his own ordering then soon will they repentthem of their secret imaginings then will the faithful say what are these they who swore by their mostsolemn oath that they were surely with you vain their works andthemselves shall come to ruin o ye who believe should any of you desert his religion god will then raiseup a people loved by him and loving him lowly towards the faithful haughtytowards the infidels for the cause of god will they contend and not fearthe blame of the blamer this is the grace of god on whom he will hebestoweth it god is vast omniscient verily your protector is god and his apostle and those who believe whoobserve prayer and pay the alms of obligation and who bow in worship and whoso take god and his apostle and those who believe for friends theytruly are the people of god they shall have the upper hand o ye who believe take not such of those who have received the scripturesbefore you as scoff and jest at your religion or the infidels for yourfriends but fear god if ye are believers nor those who when ye call to prayer make it an object of raillery andderision this they do because they are a people who understand not say o people of the book do ye not disavow us only because we believe ingod and in what he hath sent down to us and in what he hath sent downaforetime and because most of you are doers of ill say can i announce to you any retribution worse than that which awaiteththem with god they whom god hath cursed and with whom he hath been angry some of them hath he changed into apes and swine and they who worshipthagout are in evil plight and have gone far astray from the right path when they presented themselves to you they said we believe but infidelsthey came in unto you and infidels they went forth god well knew what theyconcealed many of them shalt thou see hastening together to wickedness and malice andto eat unlawful things shame on them for what they have done had not their doctors and teachers forbidden their uttering wickedness andtheir eating unlawful food bad indeed would have been their doings the hand of god say the jews is chained up their own hands shall bechained up and for that which they have said shall they be cursed nay outstretched are both his hands at his own pleasure does he bestow gifts that which hath been sent down to thee from thy lord will surely increase therebellion and unbelief of many of them and we have put enmity and hatredbetween them that shall last till the day of the resurrection oft as theykindle a beacon fire for war shall god quench it and their aim will be toabet disorder on the earth but god loveth not the abettors of disorder but if the people of the book believe and have the fear of god we willsurely put away their sins from them and will bring them into gardens ofdelight and if that they observe the law and the evangel and what hath beensent down to them from their lord they shall surely have their fill of goodthings from above them and from beneath their feet some there are among themwho act aright but many of them how evil are their doings o apostle proclaim all that hath been sent down to thee from thy lord forif thou do it not thou hast not proclaimed his message at all and god willprotect thee from evil men verily god guideth not the unbelievers say o people of the book ye have no ground to stand on until ye observethe law and the evangel and that which hath been sent down to you from yourlord the book which hath been sent down to thee from thy lord willcertainly increase the rebellion and unbelief of many of them but be notthou troubled for the unbelievers verily they who believe and the jews and the sabeites and thechristians whoever of them believeth in god and in the last day and dothwhat is right on them shall come no fear neither shall they be put togrief of old we accepted the covenant of the children of israel and sent apostlesto them oft as an apostle came to them with that for which they had nodesire some they treated as liars and some they slew and they reckoned that no harm would come of it but they became blind anddeaf then was god turned unto them then many of them again became blind anddeaf but god beheld what they did infidels now are they who say god is the messiah son of mary for themessiah said o children of israel worship god my lord and your lord whoever shall join other gods with god god shall forbid him the garden andhis abode shall be the fire and the wicked shall have no helpers they surely are infidels who say god is the third of three for there isno god but one god and if they refrain not from what they say a grievouschastisement shall light on such of them as are infidels will they not therefore be turned unto god and ask pardon of him sincegod is forgiving merciful the messiah son of mary is but an apostle other apostles have flourishedbefore him and his mother was a just person they both ate food behold how we make clear to them the signs then behold how they turn aside say will ye worship beside god that which can neither hurt nor help butgod he only heareth knoweth say o people of the book outstep not bounds of truth in your religion neither follow the desires of those who have already gone astray and whohave caused many to go astray and have themselves gone astray from theevenness of the way those among the children of israel who believed not were cursed by the tongueof david and of jesus son of mary this because they were rebellious and became transgressors they forbade not one another the iniquity whichthey wrought detestable are their actions thou shalt see many of them make friends of the infidels evil the actionswhich their own passions have sent on beforehand for god is angry with them and in torment shall they abide for ever but if they had believed in god and the prophet and the koran which hathbeen sent down to him they had not taken them for their friends butperverse are most of them of all men thou wilt certainly find the jews and those who join other godswith god to be the most intense in hatred of those who believe and thoushalt certainly find those to be nearest in affection to them who say weare christians this because some of them are priests and monks andbecause they are free from pride and when they hear that which hath been sent down to the apostle thou seesttheir eyes overflow with tears at the truth they recognise therein saying o our lord we believe write us down therefore with those who bear witnessto it and why should we not believe in god and in the truth which hath come downto us and crave that our lord would bring us into paradise with the just therefore hath god rewarded them for these their words with gardens neathwhich the rivers flow they shall abide therein for ever this the reward ofthe righteous but they who believe not and treat our signs as lies shall bethe inmates of hell fire o ye who believe interdict not the healthful viands which god hath allowedyou go not beyond this limit god loveth not those who outstep it and eat of what god hath given you for food that which is lawful andwholesome and fear god in whom ye believe god will not punish you for a mistaken word in your oaths but he will punishyou in regard to an oath taken seriously its expiation shall be to feedten poor persons with such middling food as ye feed your own families with or to clothe them or to set free a captive but he who cannot find means shall fast three days this is the expiation of your oaths when ye shall havesworn keep then your oaths thus god maketh his signs clear to you that yemay give thanks o believers surely wine and games of chance and statues and the diviningarrows are an abomination of satan s work avoid them that ye may prosper only would satan sow hatred and strife among you by wine and games ofchance and turn you aside from the remembrance of god and from prayer willye not therefore abstain from them obey god and obey the apostle and beon your guard but if ye turn back know that our apostle is only bound todeliver a plain announcement no blame shall attach to those who believe and do good works in regard toany food they have taken in case they fear god and believe and do thethings that are right and shall still fear god and believe and shall stillfear him and do good for god loveth those who do good o ye who believe god will surely make trial of you with such game as ye maytake with your hands or your lances that god may know who feareth him insecret and whoever after this transgresseth shall suffer a grievouschastisement o believers kill no game while ye are on pilgrimage whosoever among youshall purposely kill it shall comsent pensate for it in domestic animals ofequal value according to the judgment of two just persons among you to bebrought as an offering to the caaba or in expiation thereof shall feed thepoor or as the equivalent of this shall fast that he may taste the illconsequence of his deed god forgiveth what is past but whoever doth itagain god will take vengeance on him for god is mighty and vengeance ishis it is lawful for you to fish in the sea and to eat fish as provision foryou and for those who travel but it is unlawful for you to hunt by landwhile ye are still on pilgrimage fear ye god therefore before whom yeshall be assembled god hath appointed the caaba the sacred house to be a station formankind and the sacred month and the offering and its ornaments this that ye may know that god knoweth all that is in the heavens and on theearth and that god hath knowledge of everything know that god is severe inpunishing and that god is forgiving merciful the apostle is only bound to preach and god knoweth what ye bring to light and what ye conceal say the evil and the good shall not be valued alike even though theabundance of evil please thee therefore fear god o ye of understanding that it may be well with you o believers ask us not of things which if they were told might only painyou but if ye ask of such things when the entire koran shall have been sentdown they will be declared to you god will pardon you for this for god isforgiving gracious they who were before you asked concerning such things and afterwards quickly disbelieved thereingod hath not ordained anything on the subject of bahira or saïba orwasila or hami but the unbelievers have invented this lie against god and most of them had no understanding and when it was said to them accede to that which god hath sent down andto the apostle they said sufficient for us is the faith in which we foundour fathers what though their fathers knew nothing and had no guidance o believers take heed to yourselves he who erreth shall not hurt you whenye have the guidance to god shall ye all return and he will tell you thatwhich ye have done o believers let there be witnesses between you when death draweth nigh toany of you at the time of making the testament two witnesses just men fromamong yourselves or two others of a different tribe from yourselves if ye bejourneying in the earth and the calamity of death surprise you ye shallshut them both up after the prayer and if ye doubt them they shall swearby god we will not take a bribe though the party be of kin to us neitherwill we conceal the testimony of god for then we should be among thewicked but if it shall be made clear that both have been guilty of a falsehood twoothers of those who have convicted them thereof the two nearest in bloodshall stand up in their place and they shall swear by god verily ourwitness is more true than the witness of these two neither have we advancedanything untrue for then should we be of the unjust thus will it be easier for men to bear a true witness or fear lest aftertheir oath another oath be given therefore fear god and hearken for godguideth not the perverse one day will god assemble the apostles and say what reply was made toyou they shall say we have no knowledge but thou art the knower ofsecrets when he shall say o jesus son of mary call to mind my favour upon thee andupon thy mother when i strengthened thee with the holy spirit that thoushouldest speak to men alike in the cradle and when grown up and when i taught thee the scripture and wisdom and the law and theevangel and thou didst create of clay as it were the figure of a bird bymy leave and didst breathe into it and by my leave it became a bird andthou didst heal the blind and the leper by my leave and when by my leave thou didst bring forth the dead and when i withheld the children of israelfrom thee when thou hadst come to them with clear tokens and such of themas believed not said this is nought but plain sorcery and when i revealed unto the apostles believe on me and on my sent one they said we believe and bear thou witness that we are muslims remember when the apostles said o jesus son of mary is thy lord able tosend down a furnished table to us out of heaven he said fear god if ye bebelievers they said we desire to eat therefrom and to have our hearts assured and toknow that thou hast indeed spoken truth to us and to be witnesses thereof jesus son of mary said o god our lord send down a table to us out ofheaven that it may become a recurring festival to us to the first of us andto the last of us and a sign from thee and do thou nourish us for thou artthe best of nourishers and god said verily i will cause it to descend unto you but whoever amongyou after that shall disbelieve i will surely chastise him with achastisement wherewith i will not chastise any other creature and when god shall say o jesus son of mary hast thou said unto mankind take me and my mother as two gods beside god he shall say glory be untothee it is not for me to say that which i know to be not the truth had isaid that verily thou wouldest have known it thou knowest what is in me but i know not what is in thee for thou well knowest things unseen i spake not to them aught but that which thou didst bid me worship god mylord and your lord and i was a witness of their actions while i stayedamong them but since thou hast taken me to thyself thou hast thyselfwatched them and thou art witness of all things if thou punish them they are thy servants and if thou forgive them thou verily art the mighty the wise god will say this day shall their truth advantage the truthful gardens shallthey have neath which the rivers flow and remain therein for ever god iswell pleased with them and they with him this shall be the great bliss unto god belongeth the sovereignty of the
